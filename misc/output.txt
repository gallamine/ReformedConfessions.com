<br></span><span style="font-family: BaskervilleMT; font-size:9px">blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of  the people: the Holy Ghost
<br>this signifying, that the way into the holiest of  all was not yet made manifest, while as

<br>service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; which stood only in meats and drinks,
<br>and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of  refor-

<br>more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of  this building;
<br>neither by the blood of  goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into
<br>the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.… It was therefore neces-
<br>sary that the patterns of  things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the

<br>upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the
<br>sabbath. And  it  came  to  pass,  that  when  the  gates  of   Jerusalem  began  to  be  dark
<br>before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they
<br>should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of  my servants set I at the gates,
