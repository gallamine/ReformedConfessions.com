THE

CONFESSION OF FAITH

Chapter 1

Of  the Holy Scripture

1.  Although the light of  nature, and the works of  creation and
providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of
God, as to leave men unexcusable;a yet are they not sufficient to give
that  knowledge  of   God,  and  of   his  will,  which  is  necessary  unto
salvation.b  Therefore  it  pleased  the  Lord,  at  sundry  times,  and  in
divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his
a.  Rom. 2:14–15. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature
the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
which shew the work of  the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another.
Rom. 1:19–20. Because that which may be known of  God is manifest in them; for
God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of  him from the creation of  the
world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
power  and  Godhead;  so  that  they  are  without  excuse.    Ps.  19:1–4.  The  heavens
declare the glory of  God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day
uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor
language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth,
and their words to the end of  the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun.
See Rom. 1:32–2:1.

b.  John 17:3. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.  1 Cor. 1:21. For after that in the wis-
dom of  God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of
preaching to save them that believe.  1 Cor. 2:13–14. … which things also we speak,
not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth;
comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things
of  the Spirit of  God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned.

church;c and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating
of  the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of  the
church against the corruption of  the flesh, and the malice of  Satan
and of  the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing:d which
maketh the Holy Scripture to be most necessary;e those former ways
of  God’s revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.f

2.  Under the name of  Holy Scripture, or the Word of  God writ-
ten, are now contained all the books of  the Old and New Testament,
which are these:

c.  Heb. 1:1–2. God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,
whom he hath appointed heir of  all things, by whom also he made the worlds.

d.  Luke 1:3–4. It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
that thou mightest know the certainty of  those things, wherein thou hast been in-
structed.  Rom. 15:4. For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
our learning, that we through patience and comfort of  the scriptures might have hope.
Matt. 4:4,  7,  10. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of  the mouth of  God.… Jesus said unto
him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.… Then saith Jesus
unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
God, and him only shalt thou serve.  Isa. 8:20. To the law and to the testimony: if
they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

e.  2 Tim. 3:15. … and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Pet. 1:19. We have also a more sure word of  prophecy; whereunto ye do well that
ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
day star arise in your hearts.

f.  John 20:31. But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of  God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.  1  Cor.
14:37. If  any man think himself  to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge
that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of  the Lord.  1 John
5:13. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of  the Son of
God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name
of  the Son of  God.  1 Cor. 10:11. Now all these things happened unto them for
ensamples:  and  they  are  written  for  our  admonition,  upon  whom  the  ends  of   the
world are come.  Heb. 1:1–2. God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake
in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by
his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of  all things, by whom also he made the worlds.
Heb. 2:2–4. For if  the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression
and disobedience received a just recompence of  reward; how shall we escape, if  we
neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with
signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of  the Holy Ghost, according to
his own will?

ets; let them hear them.… And he said unto him, If  they hear not Moses and the
prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.  Luke 24:27,
44. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
scriptures the things concerning himself.… And he said unto them, These are the
words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,
which were written in the law of  Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, con-
cerning me.  2 Tim. 3:15–16. … and that from a child thou hast known the holy
scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in
Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of  God, and is profitable for doctrine,

4

THE CONFESSION OF FAITH

CHAPTER 1

3.  The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of  divine
inspiration, are no part of  the canon of  the Scripture, and therefore
are of  no authority in the church of  God, nor to be any otherwise
approved, or made use of, than other human writings.h

4.  The authority of  the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
believed, and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of  any man,
or church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof:
and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of  God.i

5.  We may be moved and induced by the testimony of  the church
to an high and reverent esteem of  the Holy Scripture.k And the heav-
enliness of  the matter, the efficacy of  the doctrine, the majesty of  the
style, the consent of  all the parts, the scope of  the whole (which is, to
give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of  the only way of
man’s salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the
entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly

for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.  John 5:46–47. For had ye
believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of  me. But if  ye believe not
his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

h.  Rev. 22:18–19. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of  the
prophecy of  this book, If  any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him
the plagues that are written in this book: and if  any man shall take away from the
words of  the book of  this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of  the book of
life, and out of  the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.  Rom.
3:2. Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of
God.  2 Pet. 1:21. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of  man: but holy
men of  God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

i.  2 Pet. 1:19–20. We have also a more sure word of  prophecy; whereunto ye do
well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn,
and the day star arise in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of  the scrip-
ture is of  any private interpretation.  2 Tim. 3:16. All scripture is given by inspiration
of  God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness.  1 John 5:9. If  we receive the witness of  men, the witness of  God is
greater: for this is the witness of  God which he hath testified of  his Son.  1 Thess.
2:13. For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the
word of  God which ye heard of  us, ye received it not as the word of  men, but as it is in
truth, the word of  God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.  Rev. 1:1–2.
The Revelation of  Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants
things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto
his servant John: who bare record of  the word of  God, and of  the testimony of  Jesus
Christ, and of  all things that he saw.

k.  1 Tim. 3:15. … but if  I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
to behave thyself  in the house of  God, which is the church of  the living God, the pillar
and ground of  the truth.

CHAPTER 1

evidence itself  to be the Word of  God: yet notwithstanding, our full
persuasion and assurance of  the infallible truth and divine authority
thereof, is from the inward work of  the Holy Spirit bearing witness
by and with the Word in our hearts.l

6.  The whole counsel of  God concerning all things necessary for
his own glory, man’s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set
down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be
deduced  from  Scripture:  unto  which  nothing  at  any  time  is  to  be
added, whether by new revelations of  the Spirit, or traditions of  men.m
Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of  the Spirit

l.  1 Cor. 2:9–10. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of  man, the things which God hath prepared for them that
love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all
things, yea, the deep things of  God.  Heb. 4:12. For the word of  God is quick, and
powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asun-
der of  soul and spirit, and of  the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of  the thoughts
and intents of  the heart.  John 10:35. If  he called them gods, unto whom the word of
God came, and the scripture cannot be broken …  Isa. 55:11. So shall my word be
that goeth forth out of  my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accom-
plish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.  See Rom.
11:36.  Ps. 19:7–11. The law of  the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testi-
mony of  the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of  the LORD are right,
rejoicing the heart: the commandment of  the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The
fear of  the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of  the LORD are true and
righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
and in keeping of  them there is great reward.  See 2 Tim. 3:15.  1 Cor. 2:4–5. And
my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of  man’s wisdom, but in
demonstration of  the Spirit and of  power: that your faith should not stand in the
wisdom of  men, but in the power of  God.  1 Thess. 1:5. For our gospel came not
unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assur-
ance; as ye know what manner of  men we were among you for your sake.  1 John
2:20,  27. But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.… But
the anointing which ye have received of  him abideth in you, and ye need not that any
man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of  all things, and is truth, and
is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  See Isa. 59:21.

m.  2 Tim. 3:16–17. All scripture is given by inspiration of  God, and is profit-
able for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the
man of  God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.  Gal. 1:8–9.
But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now
again, If  any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let
him be accursed.  2 Thess. 2:2. … that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of  Christ is at
hand.

of  God to be necessary for the saving understanding of  such things
as are revealed in the Word:n and that there are some circumstances
concerning the worship of  God, and government of  the church, com-
mon to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the
light  of   nature,  and  Christian  prudence,  according  to  the  general
rules of  the Word, which are always to be observed.o

7.  All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
alike clear unto all:p yet those things which are necessary to be known,
believed, and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded, and
opened in some place of  Scripture or other, that not only the learned,
but the unlearned, in a due use of  the ordinary means, may attain
unto a sufficient understanding of  them.q

n.  John 6:45. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of  God.
Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of  the Father, cometh unto
me.  1 Cor. 2:12,  14–15. Now we have received, not the spirit of  the world, but the
spirit which is of  God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
God.… But the natural man receiveth not the things of  the Spirit of  God: for they are
foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself  is judged of  no man.  Eph.
1:18. … the eyes of  your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is
the hope of  his calling, and what the riches of  the glory of  his inheritance in the saints.
See 2 Cor. 4:6.

o.  1 Cor. 11:13–14. Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto
God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself  teach you, that, if  a man have long hair,
it is a shame unto him?  1 Cor. 14:26,  40. How is it then, brethren? when ye come
together, every one of  you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revela-
tion, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.… Let all things be
done decently and in order.

p.  2 Pet. 3:16. … as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of  these things; in
which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and
unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

q.  Ps. 119:105,  130. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my
path.… The entrance of  thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.
Deut. 29:29. The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the
words of  this law.  Deut. 30:10–14. If  thou shalt hearken unto the voice of  the LORD
thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of
the law, and if  thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul. For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from
thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for
us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond
the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and
in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.  Acts 17:11. These were more noble than those

8.    The  Old  Testament  in  Hebrew  (which  was  the  native  lan-
guage of  the people of  God of  old), and the New Testament in Greek
(which, at the time of  the writing of  it, was most generally known to
the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by his singular
care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;r
so as, in all controversies of  religion, the church is finally to appeal
unto them.s But, because these original tongues are not known to all
the people of  God, who have right unto, and interest in the Scrip-
tures, and are commanded, in the fear of  God, to read and search
them,t therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of
every nation unto which they come,u that, the Word of  God dwelling
plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner;w
and, through patience and comfort of  the Scriptures, may have hope.x
9.  The infallible rule of  interpretation of  Scripture is the Scrip-
ture itself: and therefore, when there is a question about the true and
full sense of  any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be

in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of  mind, and searched
the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

r.  Matt. 5:18. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  Ps. 119:89. For ever, O
LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

s.  Isa. 8:20. To the law and to the testimony: if  they speak not according to this
word, it is because there is no light in them.  Matt. 15:3,  6. But he answered and said
unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of  God by your tradition?…
and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the
commandment of  God of  none effect by your tradition.  Acts 15:15. And to this
agree the words of  the prophets; as it is written …  See Luke 16:31.

t.  John 5:39. Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and
they are they which testify of  me.  Acts 17:11. These were more noble than those in
Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of  mind, and searched
the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.  Rev. 1:3. Blessed is he that readeth,
and they that hear the words of  this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
therein: for the time is at hand.  See 2 Tim. 3:14–15.

u.  Matt. 28:19–20. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto
the end of  the world. Amen.  See 1 Cor. 14:6; Mark 15:34.

w.  Col. 3:16. Let the word of  Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
grace in your hearts to the Lord.  See Ex. 20:4–6; Matt. 15:7–9.

learning, that we through patience and comfort of  the scriptures might have hope.

John 5:46. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of

z.  Matt. 22:29,  31. Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
the scriptures, nor the power of  God.… But as touching the resurrection of  the dead,
have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying …  Acts 28:25. And
when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken
one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers …  See
1 John 4:1–6.

a.  Deut. 6:4. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD.  1 Cor. 8:4,  6. As
concerning therefore the eating of  those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols,
we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but
one.… But to us there is but one God, the Father, of  whom are all things, and we in
him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.  See Gal.
3:20.

b.  1 Thess. 1:9. For they themselves shew of  us what manner of  entering in we

Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
hell; what canst thou know? The measure thereof  is longer than the earth, and broader
than the sea.  Job 26:14. Lo, these are parts of  his ways: but how little a portion is

tude of  any figure, the likeness of  male or female.  Cf. John 4:24 with Luke 24:39.
g.  Acts 14:11,  15. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
their voices, saying in the speech of  Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the

passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto
the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are
therein.

h.  James 1:17. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down  from  the  Father  of   lights,  with  whom  is  no  variableness,  neither  shadow  of

i.  1 Kings 8:27. But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
heaven of  heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?
Jer. 23:23–24. Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off ? Can any

2.  God hath all life,a glory,b goodness,c blessedness,d in and of
himself; and is alone in and unto himself  all-sufficient, not standing
in need of  any creatures which he hath made,e nor deriving any glory

things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.  See Rev. 4:11.

and  truth,  keeping  mercy  for  thousands,  forgiving  iniquity  and  transgression  and
sin,  and  that  will  by  no  means  clear  the  guilty;  visiting  the  iniquity  of   the  fathers
upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth
generation.

w.  Heb. 11:6. But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh
to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of  them that diligently seek
him.

x.  Neh. 9:32–33. Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the ter-
rible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before
thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on
our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of  the kings of
Assyria unto this day. Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast

nothing is to him contingent, or uncertain.l He is most holy in all his

thee with the dew of  heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that
the most High ruleth in the kingdom of  men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.…
and all the inhabitants of  the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to
his will in the army of  heaven, and among the inhabitants of  the earth: and none can
stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  See 1 Tim. 6:15.

i.  Heb. 4:13. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all

things are naked and opened unto the eyes of  him with whom we have to do.

k.  Rom. 11:33–34. O the depth of  the riches both of  the wisdom and knowl-
edge of  God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For
who hath known the mind of  the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?  Ps. 147:5.

world.  Ezek. 11:5. And the Spirit of  the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me,

down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

God the Holy Ghost:o the Father is of  none, neither begotten, nor
proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of  the Father;p the Holy
Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son.q

Chapter 3

Of  God’s Eternal Decree

1.  God, from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel
of  his own will, freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes
to pass:a yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of  sin,b nor is
violence offered to the will of  the creatures; nor is the liberty or con-
tingency of  second causes taken away, but rather established.c

o.  Matt. 3:16–17. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of  God
descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying,
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore,
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and
of  the Holy Ghost.  2 Cor. 13:14. The grace of  the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
God, and the communion of  the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.  See Eph. 2:18.
p.  John 1:14,  18. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of  the only begotten of  the Father,) full of  grace and
truth.… No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the
bosom of  the Father, he hath declared him.  See Heb. 1:2–3; Col. 1:15.

q.  John 15:26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you
from the Father, even the Spirit of  truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall
testify of  me.  Gal. 4:6. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of  his
Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

a.  Ps. 33:11. The counsel of  the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of  his
heart to all generations.  Eph. 1:11. … in whom also we have obtained an inheritance,
being predestinated according to the purpose of  him who worketh all things after the
counsel of  his own will.  Heb. 6:17. Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew
unto the heirs of  promise the immutability of  his counsel, confirmed it by an oath.

b.  Ps. 5:4. For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall
evil dwell with thee.  James 1:13–14. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am
tempted of  God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
but  every  man  is  tempted,  when  he  is  drawn  away  of   his  own  lust,  and  enticed.
1 John 1:5. This then is the message which we have heard of  him, and declare unto
you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.  See Hab. 1:13.

17:12. But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but
have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of  man suffer
of  them.  Acts 4:27–28. For of  a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of  Israel,
were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
before to be done.   John 19:11. Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all
against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto
thee hath the greater sin.  Prov. 16:33. The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole
disposing thereof  is of  the LORD.

d.  1 Sam. 23:11–12. Will the men of  Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will
Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of  Israel, I beseech thee, tell
thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down. Then said David, Will the men of
Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of  Saul? And the LORD said, They will
deliver thee up.  Matt. 11:21,  23. Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida!
for if  the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.… And thou, Capernaum,
which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if  the mighty works,
which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until
this day.

e.    Rom.  9:11,   13,   16,   18.  …  (for  the  children  being  not  yet  born,  neither
having done any good or evil, that the purpose of  God according to election might
stand, not of  works, but of  him that calleth;) … As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but
Esau have I hated.… So then it is not of  him that willeth, nor of  him that runneth, but
of  God that sheweth mercy.… Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy,
and whom he will he hardeneth.

f.  1 Tim. 5:21. I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another,
doing nothing by partiality.  Jude 6. And the angels which kept not their first estate,
but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of  the great day.  Matt. 25:31,  41. When the Son of  man shall
come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of
his glory.… Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.

5.  Those of  mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, be-
fore the foundation of  the world was laid, according to his eternal
and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of
his will, hath chosen, in Christ, unto everlasting glory,i out of  his mere

much longsuffering the vessels of  wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make
known the riches of  his glory on the vessels of  mercy, which he had afore prepared
unto glory.  Prov. 16:4. The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the
wicked for the day of  evil.

h.  John 13:18. I speak not of  you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against
me. 2 Tim. 2:19. Nevertheless the foundation of  God standeth sure, having this seal,
The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of
Christ depart from iniquity.  See John 10:14–16,  27–28; 17:2,  6,  9–12.

i.  Eph. 1:4,  9,  11. … according as he hath chosen us in him before the founda-
tion of  the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.…
having made known unto us the mystery of  his will, according to his good pleasure
which he hath purposed in himself  … in whom also we have obtained an inheritance,
being predestinated according to the purpose of  him who worketh all things after the
counsel of  his own will.  Rom. 8:28–30. And we know that all things work together
for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of
his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did
predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and
whom he justified, them he also glorified.  2 Tim. 1:9. … who hath saved us, and
called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own
purpose  and  grace,  which  was  given  us  in  Christ  Jesus  before  the  world  began.
1 Thess. 5:9. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our
Lord Jesus Christ.

k.  Rom. 9:11,  13,  15–16. … (for the children being not yet born, neither hav-
ing done any good or evil, that the purpose of  God according to election might stand,
not of  works, but of  him that calleth;) … As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
have I hated.… For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of  him
that willeth, nor of  him that runneth, but of  God that sheweth mercy.  Eph. 2:8–9.
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of  yourselves: it is the gift of  God:
not of  works, lest any man should boast.  See Eph. 1:5,  9,  11.

trusted in Christ.

m.  1 Pet. 1:2. … elect according to the foreknowledge of  God the Father, through
sanctification of  the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of  the blood of  Jesus Christ:
Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.  Eph. 2:10. For we are his workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we
should walk in them.  2 Thess. 2:13. But we are bound to give thanks alway to God
for you, brethren beloved of  the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen
you to salvation through sanctification of  the Spirit and belief  of  the truth.

n.  1 Thess. 5:9–10. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we
should live together with him.  Titus 2:14. … who gave himself  for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself  a peculiar people, zealous of  good
works.

o.  Rom. 8:30. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
See Eph. 1:5; 2 Thess. 2:13.

p.  1 Pet. 1:5. … who are kept by the power of  God through faith unto salvation

ready to be revealed in the last time.

q.  John 10:14–15,  26. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am
known of  mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down
my life for the sheep.… But ye believe not, because ye are not of  my sheep, as I said
unto you.  John 6:64–65. But there are some of  you that believe not. For Jesus knew
from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. And
he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were
given unto him of  my Father.  Rom. 8:28–39. And we know that all things work
together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the
image of  his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover
whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. What shall we then say to these
things? If  God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own Son, but
delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of  God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is
he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even
at the right hand of  God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us
from the love of  Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or

unsearchable  counsel  of   his  own  will,  whereby  he  extendeth  or
withholdeth mercy, as he pleaseth, for the glory of  his sovereign power
over his creatures, to pass by; and to ordain them to dishonor and
wrath for their sin, to the praise of  his glorious justice.r

8.  The doctrine of  this high mystery of  predestination is to be
handled with special prudence and care,s that men, attending the
will of  God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedience thereunto,
may, from the certainty of  their effectual vocation, be assured of  their
eternal election.t So shall this doctrine afford matter of  praise, rever-

nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day
long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more
than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of  God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  See John 8:47; 17:9; 1 John
2:19.

r.  Matt. 11:25–26. At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of  heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and pru-
dent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy
sight.  Rom. 9:17–18,  21–22. For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this
same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my
name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore hath he mercy on whom
he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.… Hath not the potter power over
the clay, of  the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
What if  God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with
much longsuffering the vessels of  wrath fitted to destruction.  Jude 4. For there are
certain men crept in unawares, who were before of  old ordained to this condemna-
tion, ungodly men, turning the grace of  our God into lasciviousness, and denying the
only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.  1 Pet. 2:8. … and a stone of  stumbling,
and a rock of  offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient:
whereunto also they were appointed.  2 Tim. 2:19–20. Nevertheless the foundation
of  God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let
every one that nameth the name of  Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house
there are not only vessels of  gold and of  silver, but also of  wood and of  earth; and
some to honour, and some to dishonour.

s.  Rom. 9:20. Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the
thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?  Rom. 11:33.
O the depth of  the riches both of  the wisdom and knowledge of  God! how unsearchable
are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  Deut. 29:29. The secret things
belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us
and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of  this law.

according to the election of  grace. And if  by grace, then is it no more of  works: other-
wise grace is no more grace. But if  it be of  works, then is it no more grace: otherwise
work is no more work.… Well; because of  unbelief  they were broken off, and thou

in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your

a.  Rom. 11:36. For of  him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to
whom be glory for ever. Amen.  1 Cor. 8:6. But to us there is but one God, the Father,
of  whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by him.  Heb. 1:2. [God] hath in these last days spoken unto us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of  all things, by whom also he made the worlds.
John 1:2–3. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him;
and without him was not any thing made that was made.  Gen. 1:2. And the earth
was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of  the deep. And the
Spirit of  God moved upon the face of  the waters.  Job 33:4. The Spirit of  God hath
made me, and the breath of  the Almighty hath given me life.

b.  Rom. 1:20. For the invisible things of  him from the creation of  the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
Godhead; so that they are without excuse.  Jer. 10:12. He hath made the earth by his
power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heav-
ens by his discretion.  Ps. 104:24. O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom
hast thou made them all: the earth is full of  thy riches.  Ps. 33:5. He loveth righteous-

thing  that  he  had  made,  and,  behold,  it  was  very  good. And  the  evening  and  the
morning were the sixth day.  Ps. 33:6. By the word of  the LORD were the heavens
made; and all the host of  them by the breath of  his mouth.  Heb. 11:3. Through faith
we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of  God, so that things which
are seen were not made of  things which do appear.  Col. 1:16. For by him were all
things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether
they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by
him, and for him.  Acts 17:24. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing
that he is Lord of  heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.  Ex.
20:11. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hal-
lowed it.

d.  Gen.  1:27. So God created man in his own image, in the image of  God

created he him; male and female created he them.

e.  Gen. 2:7. And the LORD God formed man of  the dust of  the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of  life; and man became a living soul.  Eccl.
12:7. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto
God who gave it.  Luke 23:43. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To
day shalt thou be with me in paradise.  Matt. 10:28. And fear not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both
soul and body in hell.

f.  Gen. 1:26. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of  the sea, and over the fowl of  the air, and
over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth.  Col. 3:10. And [ye] have put on the new man, which is renewed in
knowledge after the image of  him that created him.  Eph. 4:24. … and that ye put on
the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

g.  Rom. 2:14–15. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature
the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
which shew the work of  the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another.

h.  Gen. 2:17. But of  the tree of  the knowledge of  good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely die.  Eccl. 7:29. Lo,
this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out
many inventions.

their own will, which was subject unto change.i Beside this law writ-
ten in their hearts, they received a command, not to eat of  the tree of

happy in their communion with God,k and had dominion over the
creatures.l

i.  Gen. 3:6,  17. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of
the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did
eat.… And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of  thy
wife, and hast eaten of  the tree, of  which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
eat of  it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of  it all the days of
thy life.

k.  Gen. 2:17. But of  the tree of  the knowledge of  good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely die.  Gen. 2:15–
3:24. And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of  Eden to dress
it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of  every tree of
the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of  the tree of  the knowledge of  good and evil,
thou shalt not eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely die.…
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to
the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of  the fruit thereof, and
did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.… And they heard
the voice of  the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of  the day: and Adam
and his wife hid themselves from the presence of  the LORD God amongst the trees of
the garden.… And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
thy wife, and hast eaten of  the tree, of  which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt
not eat of  it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of  it all the days
of  thy life.… Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of  Eden, to till
the ground from whence he was taken.…

l.  Gen. 1:28. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of  the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the
earth.  See Gen. 1:29–30; Ps. 8:6–8.

a.   Neh.  9:6. Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the
heaven of  heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the
seas,  and  all  that  is  therein,  and  thou  preservest  them  all;  and  the  host  of   heaven
worshippeth thee.  Ps. 145:14–16. The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up
all those that be bowed down. The eyes of  all wait upon thee; and thou givest them

even to the least,c by his most wise and holy providence,d according
to his infallible foreknowledge,e and the free and immutable counsel

their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of  every
living thing.  Heb. 1:3. … who being the brightness of  his glory, and the express
image of  his person, and upholding all things by the word of  his power, when he had
by himself  purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of  the Majesty on high.

b.  Dan. 4:34–35. And at the end of  the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most
High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an
everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation: and all the
inhabitants of  the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in
the army of  heaven, and among the inhabitants of  the earth: and none can stay his
hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  Ps. 135:6. Whatsoever the LORD pleased,
that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.  Acts 17:25–28.
Neither is [God] worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing
he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; and hath made of  one blood all nations
of  men for to dwell on all the face of  the earth, and hath determined the times before
appointed, and the bounds of  their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if  haply
they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of  us: for
in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of  your own poets have
said, For we are also his offspring.  Job 38–41. Then the LORD answered Job out of
the whirlwind, and said,… Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of  the earth?
declare, if  thou hast understanding.… Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it
brake forth, as if  it had issued out of  the womb.… Hast thou entered into the springs
of  the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of  the depth? Have the gates of  death
been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of  the shadow of  death.… Canst
thou bind the sweet influences of  Pleiades, or loose the bands of  Orion.… Hast thou
given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder.… Hast thou an arm
like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? Deck thyself  now with majesty
and excellency; and array thyself  with glory and beauty.… Canst thou draw out levia-
than with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?…

c.  Matt. 10:29–31. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of  them
shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of  your head are all
numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of  more value than many sparrows.  See
Matt. 6:26–32.

d.  Prov. 15:3. The eyes of  the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and
the good.  2 Chron. 16:9. For the eyes of  the LORD run to and fro throughout the
whole  earth,  to  shew  himself   strong  in  the  behalf   of   them  whose  heart  is  perfect
toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt
have wars.  Ps. 104:24. O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou
made them all: the earth is full of  thy riches.  Ps. 145:17. The LORD is righteous in all
his ways, and holy in all his works.

e.  Acts 15:18. Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of  the
world.  Isa. 42:9. Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I
declare: before they spring forth I tell you of  them.  Ezek. 11:5. And the Spirit of  the

justice, goodness, and mercy.g

2.  Although, in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of  God,
the First Cause, all things come to pass immutably, and infallibly;h
yet, by the same providence, he ordereth them to fall out, according
to  the  nature  of   second  causes,  either  necessarily,  freely,  or
contingently.i

LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said,
O house of  Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of  them.
f.  Eph. 1:11. … in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predesti-
nated according to the purpose of  him who worketh all things after the counsel of  his
own will.  Ps. 33:10–11. The LORD bringeth the counsel of  the heathen to nought:
he maketh the devices of  the people of  none effect. The counsel of  the LORD standeth
for ever, the thoughts of  his heart to all generations.

g.   Isa. 63:14. As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of  the LORD
caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself  a glorious name.
Eph. 3:10. … to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of  God.  Rom. 9:17. For
the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up,
that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout
all the earth.  Gen. 45:7. And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in
the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.  Ps. 145:7. They shall abun-
dantly utter the memory of  thy great goodness, and shall sing of  thy righteousness.

h.  Acts 2:23. Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowl-
edge of  God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.  See Isa.
14:24,  27.

i.  Gen. 8:22. While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.  Jer. 31:35. Thus
saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of  the
moon and of  the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves
thereof  roar; The LORD of  hosts is his name.  Isa. 10:6–7. I will send him against an
hypocritical nation, and against the people of  my wrath will I give him a charge, to
take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of  the streets.
Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to
destroy and cut off  nations not a few.  See Ex. 21:13 and Deut. 19:5; 1 Kings
22:28–34.

k.  Acts 27:24,  31,  44b. … saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before
Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.… Paul said to the
centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.…
And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.  Isa. 55:10–11. For as the
rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth
the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and
bread to the eater: so shall my word be that goeth forth out of  my mouth: it shall not
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in

4.  The almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite good-
ness  of   God  so  far  manifest  themselves  in  his  providence,  that  it
extendeth itself  even to the first fall, and all other sins of  angels and
men;o and that not by a bare permission,p but such as hath joined
with it a most wise and powerful bounding,q and otherwise ordering,

the thing whereto I sent it.

l.  Hos. 1:7. But I will have mercy upon the house of  Judah, and will save them
by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by
horses, nor by horsemen.  Matt. 4:4. But he answered and said, It is written, Man
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of  the mouth of
God.  Job 34:20. In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at
midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.

m.  Rom. 4:19–21. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
now  dead,  when  he  was  about  an  hundred  years  old,  neither  yet  the  deadness  of
Sarah’s womb: he staggered not at the promise of  God through unbelief; but was
strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that, what he had prom-
ised, he was able also to perform.

n.  2 Kings 6:6. And the man of  God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.  Dan.
3:27. And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellers, being gath-
ered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an
hair of  their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of  fire had
passed on them.

o.  Isa. 45:7. I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil:
I the LORD do all these things.  Rom. 11:32–34. For God hath concluded them all in
unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. O the depth of  the riches both of  the
wisdom and knowledge of  God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways
past finding out! For who hath known the mind of  the Lord? or who hath been his
counseller?  2 Sam. 16:10. And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who
shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  Acts 2:23. Him, being delivered by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of  God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands
have crucified and slain.  Acts 4:27–28. For of  a truth against thy holy child Jesus,
whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the
people of  Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy coun-
sel determined before to be done.  See 2 Sam. 24:1 and 1 Chron. 21:1; 1 Kings
22:22–23; 1 Chron. 10:4,  13–14.

p.  John 12:40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they
should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and
I should heal them.  2 Thess. 2:11. And for this cause God shall send them strong
delusion, that they should believe a lie.

q.  Ps. 76:10. Surely the wrath of  man shall praise thee: the remainder of  wrath
shalt thou restrain.  2 Kings 19:28. Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is
come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy
lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

and governing of  them, in a manifold dispensation, to his own holy
ends;r yet so, as the sinfulness thereof  proceedeth only from the crea-
ture, and not from God, who, being most holy and righteous, neither
is nor can be the author or approver of  sin.s

5.  The most wise, righteous, and gracious God doth oftentimes
leave, for a season, his own children to manifold temptations, and the
corruption of  their own hearts, to chastise them for their former sins,
or to discover unto them the hidden strength of  corruption and de-
ceitfulness of  their hearts, that they may be humbled;t and, to raise
them to a more close and constant dependence for their support upon
himself, and to make them more watchful against all future occasions

r.  Gen. 50:20. But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto
good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.  Isa. 10:12. Where-
fore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon
mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of  the stout heart of  the king of
Assyria, and the glory of  his high looks.  See Isa. 10:6–7,  13–15.

s.  James 1:13–14,  17. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of
God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every
man is tempted, when he is drawn away of  his own lust, and enticed.… Every good
gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of  lights,
with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of  turning.  1 John 2:16. For all that is
in the world, the lust of  the flesh, and the lust of  the eyes, and the pride of  life, is not
of  the Father, but is of  the world.  Ps. 50:21. These things hast thou done, and I kept
silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove
thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

t.  2 Chron. 32:25–26,  31. But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the
benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him,
and upon Judah and Jerusalem. Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself  for the
pride of  his heart, both he and the inhabitants of  Jerusalem, so that the wrath of  the
LORD came not upon them in the days of  Hezekiah.… Howbeit in the business of  the
ambassadors of  the princes of  Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of  the wonder
that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in
his heart.  Deut. 8:2–3,  5. And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy
God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to
know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.
And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which
thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that
man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of  the mouth
of  the LORD doth man live.… Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man
chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.  Luke 22:31–32. And the
Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you
as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art con-
verted, strengthen thy brethren.  See 2 Sam. 24:1,  25.

6.  As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as a righ-
teous Judge, for former sins, doth blind and harden,w from them he
not only withholdeth his grace whereby they might have been en-
lightened in their understandings, and wrought upon in their hearts;x
but  sometimes  also  withdraweth  the  gifts  which  they  had,y  and
exposeth them to such objects as their corruption makes occasions of
sin;z and, withal, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations

u.  2 Cor. 12:7–9. And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abun-
dance of  the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought
the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is
sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore
will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of  Christ may rest upon me.  See
Ps. 73:1–28; 77:1–12; Mark 14:66–72; John 21:15–19.

w.  Rom. 1:24,  26,  28. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through
the lusts of  their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves.… For
this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the
natural use into that which is against nature.… And even as they did not like to retain
God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things
which are not convenient.  Rom. 11:7–8. What then? Israel hath not obtained that
which  he  seeketh  for;  but  the  election  hath  obtained  it,  and  the  rest  were  blinded
(according as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of  slumber, eyes that they
should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.

x.  Deut. 29:4. Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to
see, and ears to hear, unto this day.  Mark 4:11–12. And he said unto them, Unto
you it is given to know the mystery of  the kingdom of  God: but unto them that are
without, all these things are done in parables: that seeing they may see, and not per-
ceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be
converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

y.  Matt. 13:12. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he
hath.  Matt. 25:29. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
See Acts 13:10–11.

z.  Gen. 4:8. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they  were  in  the  field,  that  Cain  rose  up  against  Abel  his  brother,  and  slew  him.
2 Kings 8:12–13. And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Be-
cause I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of  Israel: their strong holds
wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash
their children, and rip up their women with child. And Hazael said, But what, is thy
servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD
hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.  See Matt. 26:14–16.

of  the world, and the power of  Satan,a whereby it comes to pass that
they harden themselves, even under those means which God useth
for the softening of  others.b

7.  As the providence of  God doth, in general, reach to all crea-
tures; so, after a most special manner, it taketh care of  his church,
and disposeth all things to the good thereof.c

a.  Ps. 109:6. Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.  Luke 22:3. Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of  the
number of  the twelve.  2 Thess. 2:10–12. … and with all deceivableness of  unrigh-
teousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of  the truth, that they
might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness.

b.  Ex. 8:15,  32. But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.… And Pharaoh hardened
his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.  2 Cor. 2:15–16. For we
are unto God a sweet savour of  Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
to the one we are the savour of  death unto death; and to the other the savour of  life
unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?  Isa. 8:14. And he shall be for a
sanctuary; but for a stone of  stumbling and for a rock of  offence to both the houses of
Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of  Jerusalem.  1 Pet. 2:7–8. Unto
you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the
stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of  the corner, and a
stone of  stumbling, and a rock of  offence, even to them which stumble at the word,
being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.  See Ex. 7:3; Isa. 6:9–10;
Acts 28:26–27.

c.  1 Tim. 4:10. For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of  all men, specially of  those that believe.
Amos 9:8–9. Behold, the eyes of  the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I
will destroy it from off  the face of  the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the
house of  Jacob, saith the LORD. For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of
Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall
upon the earth.  Matt. 16:18. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church; and the gates of  hell shall not prevail against it.  Rom.
8:28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
them who are the called according to his purpose.  Isa. 43:3–5,  14. For I am the
LORD thy God, the Holy One of  Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom,
Ethiopia and Seba for thee. Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for
thy life. Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee
from the west.… Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of  Israel; For
your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the
Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.

ing purposed to order it to his own glory.b

2.  By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and com-
munion with God,c and so became dead in sin,d and wholly defiled in
all the parts and faculties of  soul and body.e

a.  Gen. 3:13. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  2 Cor.
11:3. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so
your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

b.  See chapter 5,  section 4.
c.  Gen. 3:6–8. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of
the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
And the eyes of  them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and
they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice
of  the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of  the day: and Adam and his wife
hid themselves from the presence of  the LORD God amongst the trees of  the garden.
Rom. 3:23. For all have sinned, and come short of  the glory of  God.

d.  Gen. 2:17. But of  the tree of  the knowledge of  good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely die.  Eph. 2:1–3.
And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in time
past ye walked according to the course of  this world, according to the prince of  the
power of  the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of  disobedience: among
whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of  our flesh, fulfilling
the desires of  the flesh and of  the mind; and were by nature the children of  wrath,
even as others.  See Rom. 5:12.

e.  Gen. 6:5. And God saw that the wickedness of  man was great in the earth,
and that every imagination of  the thoughts of  his heart was only evil continually.  Jer.
17:9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know
it?  Titus 1:15. Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and
unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.  Rom.
3:10–19. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that
understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of  the way,
they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison
of  asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of  cursing and bitterness: their feet are

3.  They being the root of  all mankind, the guilt of  this sin was
imputed;f and the same death in sin, and corrupted nature, conveyed
to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary generation.g

posed, disabled, and made opposite to all good,h and wholly inclined

swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways: and the way of  peace
have they not known: there is no fear of  God before their eyes. Now we know that
what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every
mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

f.  Acts 17:26. And [God] hath made of  one blood all nations of  men for to dwell
on all the face of  the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the
bounds of  their habitation.  Rom. 5:12,  15–19. Wherefore, as by one man sin en-
tered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all
have sinned: (… But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if  through the
offence of  one many be dead, much more the grace of  God, and the gift by grace,
which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one
that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free
gift is of  many offences unto justification. For if  by one man’s offence death reigned by
one; much more they which receive abundance of  grace and of  the gift of  righteous-
ness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) therefore as by the offence of  one judgment
came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of  one the free gift
came upon all men unto justification of  life. For as by one man’s disobedience many
were made sinners, so by the obedience of  one shall many be made righteous.  1 Cor.
15:21–22,  49. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of
the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.… And as we
have borne the image of  the earthy, we shall also bear the image of  the heavenly.

g.  Ps. 51:5. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
me.  John 3:6. That which is born of  the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of  the
Spirit is spirit.  Gen. 5:3. And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a
son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth.  Job 15:14. What is
man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of  a woman, that he should be
righteous?

h.  Rom. 5:6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
the ungodly.  Rom. 7:18. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
Rom. 8:7. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the
law of  God, neither indeed can be.  Col. 1:21. And you, that were sometime alien-
ated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.

i.  Gen. 8:21. And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination
of  man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing
living, as I have done.  See Gen. 6:5; Rom. 3:10–12.

k.  Matt. 15:19. For out of  the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,

5.    This  corruption  of   nature,  during  this  life,  doth  remain  in
those that are regenerated;l and although it be, through Christ, par-
doned, and mortified; yet both itself, and all the motions thereof, are
truly and properly sin.m

6.  Every sin, both original and actual, being a transgression of
the righteous law of  God, and contrary thereunto,n doth, in its own
nature, bring guilt upon the sinner,o whereby he is bound over to the

fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.  James 1:14–15. But every man is
tempted, when he is drawn away of  his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath
conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.  Eph.
2:2–3. … wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of  this world, ac-
cording to the prince of  the power of  the air, the spirit that now worketh in the chil-
dren of  disobedience: among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
the lusts of  our flesh, fulfilling the desires of  the flesh and of  the mind; and were by
nature the children of  wrath, even as others.

l.  Prov. 20:9. Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
Eccl. 7:20. For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
Rom. 7:14,  17–18,  21–23. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal,
sold under sin.… Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I
know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with
me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.… I find then a law, that, when
I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of  God after the
inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of  my
mind,  and  bringing  me  into  captivity  to  the  law  of   sin  which  is  in  my  members.
1 John 1:8,  10. If  we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
not in us.… If  we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not
in us.

m.  Rom. 7:7–8,  25. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I
had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said,
Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me
all manner of  concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.… I thank God through
Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself  serve the law of  God; but with
the flesh the law of  sin.  Gal. 5:17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot
do the things that ye would.

n.  1 John 3:4. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the

transgression of  the law.

o.  Rom. 2:15. … which shew the work of  the law written in their hearts, their
conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else
excusing one another.  Rom. 3:9,  19. What then? are we better than they? No, in no
wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.…
Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the
law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before
God.

Chapter 7

Of  God’s Covenant with Man

1.  The distance between God and the creature is so great, that
although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their
Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of  him as their bless-
edness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God’s
part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of  covenant.a

p.  Eph. 2:3. … among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
the lusts of  our flesh, fulfilling the desires of  the flesh and of  the mind; and were by
nature the children of  wrath, even as others.

q.  Gal. 3:10. For as many as are of  the works of  the law are under the curse: for
it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in
the book of  the law to do them.

r.  Rom. 6:23. For the wages of  sin is death; but the gift of  God is eternal life

through Jesus Christ our Lord.

s.  Eph. 4:18. … having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
life of  God through the ignorance that is in them, because of  the blindness of  their
heart.

t.  Rom. 8:20. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of  him who hath subjected the same in hope.  Lam. 3:39. Wherefore doth a
living man complain, a man for the punishment of  his sins?

u.  Matt. 25:41. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.  2 Thess.
1:9. … who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of  the
Lord, and from the glory of  his power.

a.  Isa. 40:13–17. Who hath directed the Spirit of  the LORD, or being his counseller
hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught
him in the path of  judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way
of  understanding? Behold, the nations are as a drop of  a bucket, and are counted as
the small dust of  the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. And
Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof  sufficient for a burnt offering.
All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing,
and vanity.  Job 9:32–33. For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and
we should come together in judgment. Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that
might lay his hand upon us both.  Ps. 113:5–6. Who is like unto the LORD our God,
who dwelleth on high, who humbleth himself  to behold the things that are in heaven,
and in the earth!  Job 22:2–3. Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise
may  be  profitable  unto  himself ?  Is  it  any  pleasure  to  the  Almighty,  that  thou  art

2.  The first covenant made with man was a covenant of  works,b
wherein life was promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity,c upon
condition of  perfect and personal obedience.d

3.  Man, by his fall, having made himself  uncapable of  life by that
covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second,e commonly called
the covenant of  grace; wherein he freely offereth unto sinners life

righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?  Job 35:7–8. If  thou
be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of  thine hand? Thy wicked-
ness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of  man.
Luke 17:10. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are com-
manded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty
to do.  Acts 17:24–25. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
is Lord of  heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is
worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all
life, and breath, and all things.

b.  Gen. 2:16–17. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of  every
tree of  the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of  the tree of  the knowledge of  good
and evil, thou shalt not eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely
die.  Hos. 6:7. But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they
dealt treacherously against me.  Gal. 3:12. And the law is not of  faith: but, The man
that doeth them shall live in them.

c.  Gen. 3:22. And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of  us,
to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of  the tree of
life, and eat, and live for ever …  Rom. 10:5. For Moses describeth the righteousness
which is of  the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.  Rom.
5:12–14. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: (For until the law sin was in the
world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from
Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of  Adam’s
transgression, who is the figure of  him that was to come.…) …  See Rom. 5:15–20.
d.  Gen. 2:17. But of  the tree of  the knowledge of  good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely die.  Gal. 3:10. For
as many as are of  the works of  the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is
every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of  the law to
do them.

e.  Gal. 3:21. Is the law then against the promises of  God? God forbid: for if
there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should
have been by the law.  Rom. 3:20–21. Therefore by the deeds of  the law there shall
no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of  sin. But now the
righteousness of  God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and
the prophets.  Rom. 8:3. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of  sinful flesh, and for sin, con-
demned sin in the flesh.  Gen. 3:15. And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
bruise his heel.  See Isa. 42:6.

and salvation by Jesus Christ; requiring of  them faith in him, that
they may be saved,f and promising to give unto all those that are
ordained unto eternal life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing, and
able to believe.g

4.  This covenant of  grace is frequently set forth in Scripture by
the name of  a testament, in reference to the death of  Jesus Christ the
Testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging
to it, therein bequeathed.h

5.  This covenant was differently administered in the time of  the
law, and in the time of  the gospel:i under the law, it was administered

f.  John 3:16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Rom. 10:6,  9.
But the righteousness which is of  faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart,
Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) … that if
thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that
God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Rev. 22:17. And the Spirit
and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is
athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of  life freely.

g.  Acts 13:48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of  the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.  Ezek.
36:26–27. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and
I will take away the stony heart out of  your flesh, and I will give you an heart of  flesh.
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall
keep my judgments, and do them.  John 6:37,  44–45. All that the Father giveth me
shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.… No man can
come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up
at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of  God. Every
man  therefore  that  hath  heard,  and  hath  learned  of   the  Father,  cometh  unto  me.
1 Cor. 12:3. Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit
of  God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by
the Holy Ghost.

h.  Heb. 9:15–17. And for this cause he is the mediator of  the new testament,
that by means of  death, for the redemption of  the transgressions that were under the
first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of  eternal inheritance.
For where a testament is, there must also of  necessity be the death of  the testator. For
a testament is of  force after men are dead: otherwise it is of  no strength at all while the
testator liveth.

i.  2 Cor. 3:6–9. … [God] hath made us able ministers of  the new testament; not
of  the letter, but of  the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if  the
ministration of  death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the chil-
dren of  Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of  Moses for the glory of  his coun-
tenance; which glory was to be done away: how shall not the ministration of  the spirit
be rather glorious? For if  the ministration of  condemnation be glory, much more doth
the ministration of  righteousness exceed in glory.

by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb,
and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of  the Jews,
all foresignifying Christ to come;k which were, for that time, suffi-
cient and efficacious, through the operation of  the Spirit, to instruct
and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah,l by whom
they had full remission of  sins, and eternal salvation; and is called the
old testament.m

k.  Heb. 8–10. Now of  the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have
such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of  the throne of  the Majesty in the
heavens; a minister of  the sanctuary, and of  the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched,
and not man.… For if  he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are
priests that offer gifts according to the law: who serve unto the example and shadow of
heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of  God when he was about to make the
tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed
to thee in the mount. But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
much also he is the mediator of  a better covenant, which was established upon better
promises.… But Christ being come an high priest of  good things to come, by a greater
and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of  this building;
neither by the blood of  goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into
the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.… For Christ is not entered
into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of  the true; but into heaven
itself, now to appear in the presence of  God for us.… For the law having a shadow of
good things to come, and not the very image of  the things, can never with those sacri-
fices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.…
Rom. 4:11. And he received the sign of  circumcision, a seal of  the righteousness of
the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of  all
them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be im-
puted unto them also.  Col. 2:11–12. … in whom also ye are circumcised with the
circumcision made without hands, in putting off  the body of  the sins of  the flesh by
the circumcision of  Christ: buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
him through the faith of  the operation of  God, who hath raised him from the dead.
1 Cor. 5:7. Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are
unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.

l.  1 Cor. 10:1–4. Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were
all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual
meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of  that spiritual Rock
that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.  Heb. 11:13. These all died in faith,
not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded
of  them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on
the earth.  John 8:56. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
was glad.

m.  Gal. 3:7–9,  14. Know ye therefore that they which are of  faith, the same are
the children of  Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall

6.  Under the gospel, when Christ, the substance,n was exhibited,
the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching
of  the Word, and the administration of  the sacraments of  baptism
and the Lord’s Supper:o which, though fewer in number, and admin-
istered  with  more  simplicity,  and  less  outward  glory,  yet,  in  them,
  it  is  held  forth  in  more  fullness,  evidence,  and  spiritual  efficacy,p
to  all  nations,  both  Jews  and  Gentiles;q  and  is  called  the  new

all nations be blessed. So then they which be of  faith are blessed with faithful Abra-
ham.… that the blessing of  Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ;
that we might receive the promise of  the Spirit through faith.  Ps. 32:1–2,  5. Blessed
is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto
whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.… I ac-
knowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess
my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of  my sin. Selah.

n.  Col. 2:17. … which are a shadow of  things to come; but the body is of  Christ.
o.  1 Cor. 1:21. For after that in the wisdom of  God the world by wisdom knew
not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of  preaching to save them that believe.
Matt. 28:19–20. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name
of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all
things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end of  the world. Amen.  1 Cor. 11:23–25. For I have received of  the Lord that
which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat:
this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of  me. After the same
manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testa-
ment in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me.

p.  Heb. 12:22–24. But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of  the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of  angels, to the
general assembly and church of  the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to
God the Judge of  all, and to the spirits of  just men made perfect, and to Jesus the
mediator of  the new covenant, and to the blood of  sprinkling, that speaketh better
things than that of  Abel.  2 Cor. 3:9–11. For if  the ministration of  condemnation be
glory, much more doth the ministration of  righteousness exceed in glory. For even that
which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of  the glory that
excelleth. For if  that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth
is glorious.  Jer. 31:33–34. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the
house of  Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward
parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,
saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of  them unto the
greatest of  them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
their sin no more.

q.  Luke 2:32. … a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of  thy people
Israel.  Acts 10:34. Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of  a truth I perceive
that God is no respecter of  persons.  Eph. 2:15–19. … having abolished in his flesh

Chapter 8

Of Christ the Mediator

1.  It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain
the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between

the enmity, even the law of  commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in
himself  of  twain one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both
unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and came and
preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. For through
him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more
strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of  the household of
God.

r.  Luke 22:20. Likewise also [he took] the cup after supper, saying, This cup is

the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

s.  Gal. 3:8–9,  14,  16. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall
all nations be blessed. So then they which be of  faith are blessed with faithful Abra-
ham.… that the blessing of  Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ;
that we might receive the promise of  the Spirit through faith.… Now to Abraham and
his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of  many; but as of
one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.  Rom. 3:21–22,  30. But now the righteousness
of  God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
even the righteousness of  God which is by faith of  Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
them that believe: for there is no difference.… seeing it is one God, which shall justify
the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.  Rom. 4:3,  6–8. For
what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for
righteousness.… Even as David also describeth the blessedness of  the man, unto whom
God imputeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities
are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not
impute sin.  See Gen. 15:6.  Ps. 32:1–2. Blessed is he whose transgression is for-
given, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not
iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.  Rom. 4:16–17,  23–24. Therefore it is
of  faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed;
not to that only which is of  the law, but to that also which is of  the faith of  Abraham;
who is the father of  us all, (as it is written, I have made thee a father of  many nations,)
before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those
things which be not as though they were.… Now it was not written for his sake alone,
that it was imputed to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if  we believe
on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.  Heb. 4:2. For unto us was the
gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not
being mixed with faith in them that heard it.  See Rom. 10:6–10; 1 Cor. 10:3–4.

God and man,a the Prophet,b Priest,c and King,d the Head and Savior
of  his church,e the Heir of  all things,f and Judge of  the world:g unto
whom he did from all eternity give a people, to be his seed,h and to be
by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.i

a.  Isa. 42:1. Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gen-
tiles.  1 Pet. 1:19–20. But [ye were redeemed] with the precious blood of  Christ, as
of  a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the
foundation of  the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.  John 3:16. For
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  1 Tim. 2:5. For there is one God,
and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.

b.  Acts 3:20,  22. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached
unto you.… For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God
raise up unto you of  your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things what-
soever he shall say unto you.  See Deut. 18:15.

c.  Heb. 5:5–6. So also Christ glorified not himself  to be made an high priest; but
he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he saith also
in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of  Melchisedec.

d.  Ps. 2:6. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of  Zion.  Luke 1:33. And he
shall reign over the house of  Jacob for ever; and of  his kingdom there shall be no end.
See Isa. 9:5–6; Acts 2:29–36; Col. 1:13.

e.  Eph. 5:23. For the husband is the head of  the wife, even as Christ is the head

of  the church: and he is the saviour of  the body.

f.  Heb. 1:2. [God] hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he

hath appointed heir of  all things, by whom also he made the worlds.

g.  Acts 17:31. … because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the
world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof  he hath given
assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.

h.  John 17:6. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
out of  the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy
word.  Ps. 22:30. A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
generation.  Isa. 53:10. Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to
grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall
prolong his days, and the pleasure of  the LORD shall prosper in his hand.  Eph. 1:4.
… according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of  the world, that we
should be holy and without blame before him in love.

i.  1 Tim. 2:6. … who gave himself  a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
Isa. 55:4–5. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and com-
mander to the people. Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of  the LORD thy God, and for
the Holy One of  Israel; for he hath glorified thee.  1 Cor. 1:30. But of  him are ye in
Christ Jesus, who of  God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctifica-
tion, and redemption.  Rom. 8:30. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he
also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them
he also glorified.

CHAPTER 8

2.  The Son of  God, the second person in the Trinity, being very
and eternal God, of  one substance and equal with the Father, did,
when the fullness of  time was come, take upon him man’s nature,k
with all the essential properties, and common infirmities thereof, yet
without sin;l being conceived by the power of  the Holy Ghost, in the
womb  of   the  virgin  Mary,  of   her  substance.m  So  that  two  whole,
perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were
inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, com-
position, or confusion.n Which person is very God, and very man, yet

k.  John 1:1,  14. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.… And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and
we beheld his glory, the glory as of  the only begotten of  the Father,) full of  grace and
truth.  1 John 5:20. And we know that the Son of  God is come, and hath given us an
understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even
in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.  Phil. 2:6. … who, being
in the form of  God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.  Gal. 4:4. But when
the fulness of  the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of  a woman, made
under the law.

l.  Phil. 2:7. … but made himself  of  no reputation, and took upon him the form
of  a servant, and was made in the likeness of  men.  Heb. 2:14,  16–17. Forasmuch
then as the children are partakers of  flesh and blood, he also himself  likewise took part
of  the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of  death,
that is, the devil.… For verily he took not on him the nature of  angels; but he took on
him the seed of  Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to
God, to make reconciliation for the sins of  the people.  Heb. 4:15. For we have not an
high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of  our infirmities; but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.

m.  Luke 1:27,  31,  35. To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph,
of  the house of  David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.… And, behold, thou shalt
conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.… And
the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
power of  the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall
be born of  thee shall be called the Son of  God.  Gal. 4:4. But when the fulness of  the
time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of  a woman, made under the law.  See
Matt. 1:18,  20–21.

n.  Matt. 16:16. And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
Son of  the living God.  Col. 2:9. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of  the Godhead
bodily.  Rom. 9:5. … whose are the fathers, and of  whom as concerning the flesh
Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.  1 Tim. 3:16. And without
controversy great is the mystery of  godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in
the Spirit, seen of  angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, re-
ceived up into glory.

one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man.o

3.  The Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus united to the divine,
was sanctified, and anointed with the Holy Spirit, above measure,p
having in him all the treasures of  wisdom and knowledge;q in whom
it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell;r to the end that,
being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of  grace and truth,s he might
be thoroughly furnished to execute the office of  a mediator, and surety.t
Which office he took not unto himself, but was thereunto called by
his Father,u who put all power and judgment into his hand, and gave
him commandment to execute the same.w

4.    This  office  the  Lord  Jesus  did  most  willingly  undertake;x

o.  Rom. 1:3–4. … concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made
of  the seed of  David according to the flesh; and declared to be the Son of  God with
power, according to the spirit of  holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.  1 Tim.
2:5. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus.

p.  Ps. 45:7. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God,
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of  gladness above thy fellows.  John 3:34.
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of  God: for God giveth not the Spirit
by measure unto him.  See Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:18; Heb. 1:8–9.

q.  Col. 2:3. … in whom are hid all the treasures of  wisdom and knowledge.
r.  Col. 1:19. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.
s.  Heb. 7:26. For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, unde-
filed, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.  John 1:14. And the
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
the only begotten of  the Father,) full of  grace and truth.

t.  Acts 10:38. … how God anointed Jesus of  Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of  the
devil; for God was with him.  Heb. 12:24. … and to Jesus the mediator of  the new
covenant, and to the blood of  sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of  Abel.
Heb. 7:22. … by so much was Jesus made a surety of  a better testament.

u.  Heb. 5:4–5. And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called
of  God, as was Aaron. So also Christ glorified not himself  to be made an high priest;
but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.

w.  John 5:22,  27. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judg-
ment unto the Son.… and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
he is the Son of  man.  Matt. 28:18. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All
power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.  Acts 2:36. Therefore let all the house
of  Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have cruci-
fied, both Lord and Christ.

x.  Ps. 40:7–8. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of  the book it is written of
me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.  See Heb.
10:5–10.  John 4:34. Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of  him that sent
me, and to finish his work.  John 10:18. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down

which  that  he  might  discharge,  he  was  made  under  the  law,y
and did perfectly fulfill it;z endured most grievous torments immedi-
ately  in  his  soul,a  and  most  painful  sufferings  in  his  body;b  was
crucified, and died,c was buried, and remained under the power of
death, yet saw no corruption.d On the third day he arose from the

of  myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This com-
mandment have I received of  my Father.  Phil. 2:8. And being found in fashion as a
man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of  the cross.
y.  Gal. 4:4. But when the fulness of  the time was come, God sent forth his Son,

made of  a woman, made under the law.

z.  Matt. 3:15. And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus
it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.  Matt. 5:17. Think
not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.  Heb. 5:8–9. Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of  eternal salvation
unto all them that obey him.

a.  Matt. 26:37–38. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of  Zebedee,
and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith he unto them, My soul is ex-
ceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.  Luke 22:44.
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great
drops of  blood falling down to the ground.  Matt. 27:46. And about the ninth hour
Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

b.  Matt. 26:67–68. Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
smote him with the palms of  their hands.  Matt. 27:27–50. Then the soldiers of  the
governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of
soldiers. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And when they had
platted a crown of  thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and
they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of  the Jews!
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. And after that
they had mocked him, they took the robe off  from him, and put his own raiment on
him, and led him away to crucify him.… Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud
voice, yielded up the ghost.

c.  Mark 15:24,  37. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
casting lots upon them, what every man should take.… And Jesus cried with a loud
voice, and gave up the ghost.  Phil. 2:8. And being found in fashion as a man, he
humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of  the cross.

d.  Matt. 27:60. … and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in
the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of  the sepulchre, and departed.  Acts
2:24,  27. … whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of  death: because it
was not possible that he should be holden of  it.… because thou wilt not leave my soul
in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  Acts 13:29,  37.
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of  him, they took him down from the
tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.… But he, whom God raised again, saw no corrup-
tion.  Rom. 6:9. … knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
death hath no more dominion over him.

self, which he, through the eternal Spirit, once offered up unto God,
hath fully satisfied the justice of  his Father;k and purchased, not only

how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried,
and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.

f.  Luke 24:39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and
see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.  John 20:25,  27. The
other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them,
Except I shall see in his hands the print of  the nails, and put my finger into the print of
the  nails,  and  thrust  my  hand  into  his  side,  I  will  not  believe.…  Then  saith  he  to
Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand,
and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

g.  Luke 24:50–51. And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted
from them, and carried up into heaven.  1 Pet. 3:22. … who is gone into heaven, and
is on the right hand of  God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject
unto him.

h.  Rom. 8:34. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that
is risen again, who is even at the right hand of  God, who also maketh intercession for
us.  Heb. 7:25. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  See Heb.
9:24.

i.  Acts 1:11. … which also said, Ye men of  Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.  John 5:28–29. Marvel not at this: for
the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall
come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of  life; and they that have
done evil, unto the resurrection of  damnation.  Rom. 14:10b. … for we shall all
stand before the judgment seat of  Christ.  Acts 10:42. And he commanded us to
preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of  God to be the
Judge of  quick and dead.  Matt. 13:40–42. As therefore the tares are gathered and
burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of  this world. The Son of  man shall send
forth his angels, and they shall gather out of  his kingdom all things that offend, and
them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of  fire: there shall be wail-
ing and gnashing of  teeth.  Jude 6. And the angels which kept not their first estate,
but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of  the great day.  See 2 Pet. 2:4.

the obedience of  one shall many be made righteous.  Heb. 9:14. How much more

Christ till after his incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefits
thereof  were communicated unto the elect, in all ages successively
from the beginning of  the world, in and by those promises, types,
and sacrifices, wherein he was revealed, and signified to be the seed

slain from the beginning of  the world; being yesterday and today the

For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  Eph. 5:2.
… and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself  for us an
offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  Rom. 3:25–26. … whom
God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righ-
teousness for the remission of  sins that are past, through the forbearance of  God; to
declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of
him which believeth in Jesus.

l.  Dan. 9:24. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of  sins, and to make reconciliation
for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.  2 Cor. 5:18. And all things are of  God, who
hath reconciled us to himself  by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
reconciliation.  Col. 1:20. … and, having made peace through the blood of  his cross,
by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in
earth, or things in heaven.  Eph. 1:11,  14. … in whom also we have obtained an
inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of  him who worketh all
things after the counsel of  his own will.… which is the earnest of  our inheritance until
the redemption of  the purchased possession, unto the praise of  his glory.  Heb. 9:12,
15. Neither by the blood of  goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once
into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.… And for this cause
he is the mediator of  the new testament, that by means of  death, for the redemption
of  the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might
receive the promise of  eternal inheritance.  John 17:2. … as thou hast given him
power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
m.  Gal. 4:4–5. But when the fulness of  the time was come, God sent forth his
Son, made of  a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law,
that we might receive the adoption of  sons.  Gen. 3:15. And I will put enmity be-
tween thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy
head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  1 Cor. 10:4. And [our fathers] did all drink the
same spiritual drink: for they drank of  that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that
Rock was Christ.  Rev. 13:8. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,
whose names are not written in the book of  life of  the Lamb slain from the foundation
of  the world.  Heb. 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

7.  Christ, in the work of  mediation, acts according to both na-
tures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself;n yet, by
reason of  the unity of  the person, that which is proper to one nature
is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by
the other nature.o

8.  To all those for whom Christ hath purchased redemption, he
doth  certainly  and  effectually  apply  and  communicate  the  same;p
making intercession for them,q and revealing unto them, in and by
the Word, the mysteries of  salvation;r effectually persuading them by
his Spirit to believe and obey, and governing their hearts by his Word

n.  John 10:17–18. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my
life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of  myself.
I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment
have I received of  my Father.  1 Pet. 3:18. For Christ also hath once suffered for sins,
the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,
but quickened by the Spirit.  Heb. 1:3. … who being the brightness of  his glory, and
the express image of  his person, and upholding all things by the word of  his power,
when he had by himself  purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of  the Majesty on
high.  See Heb. 9:14.

o.  Acts 20:28. Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the
which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of  God, which he
hath purchased with his own blood.  Luke 1:43. And whence is this to me, that the
mother of  my Lord should come to me?  See Rom. 9:5.

p.  John 6:37,  39. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.… And this is the Father’s will which hath sent
me, that of  all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up
again at the last day.  John 10:15–16,  27–28. As the Father knoweth me, even so
know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which
are not of  this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there
shall be one fold, and one shepherd.… My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them out of  my hand.

q.    1  John  2:1.  My  little  children,  these  things  write  I  unto  you,  that  ye  sin
not.  And  if   any  man  sin,  we  have  an  advocate  with  the  Father,  Jesus  Christ  the
righteous.  Rom. 8:34. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of  God, who also maketh intercession
for us.

r.  John 15:15. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of  my
Father I have made known unto you.  Eph. 1:9. … having made known unto us the
mystery of  his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.
John 17:6. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of  the

brance, whatsoever I have said unto you.  2 Cor. 4:13. We having the same spirit of
faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe,
and therefore speak.  Rom. 8:9,  14. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if  so
be that the Spirit of  God dwell in you. Now if  any man have not the Spirit of  Christ,
he is none of  his.… For as many as are led by the Spirit of  God, they are the sons of
God.  Rom. 15:18–19. For I will not dare to speak of  any of  those things which
Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of  the Spirit of  God; so that from
Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of  Christ.
John 17:17. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

t.  Ps. 110:1. The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
make thine enemies thy footstool.  1 Cor. 15:25–26. For he must reign, till he hath
put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.  Col.
2:15. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of  them openly,
triumphing over them in it.  Luke 10:19. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on
serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of  the enemy: and nothing shall by any
means hurt you.

a.  James 1:13–14. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of  God:
for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is
tempted, when he is drawn away of  his own lust, and enticed.  Deut. 30:19. I call
heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and
death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.
Isa. 7:11–12. Ask thee a sign of  the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in
the height above. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.  Matt.
17:12. But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but
have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of  man suffer
of  them.  John 5:40. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.  James 4:7.
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

and to do that which was good and well pleasing to God;b but yet,
mutably, so that he might fall from it.c

3.  Man, by his fall into a state of  sin, hath wholly lost all ability of
will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation:d so as, a natural
man, being altogether averse from that good,e and dead in sin,f is not
able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself
thereunto.g

b.  Eccl. 7:29. Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but
they have sought out many inventions.  Gen. 1:26,  31. And God said, Let us make
man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of  the
sea, and over the fowl of  the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.… And God saw every thing that he
had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the
sixth day.  Col. 3:10. And [ye] have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowl-
edge after the image of  him that created him.

c.  Gen. 2:16–17. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of  every
tree of  the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of  the tree of  the knowledge of  good
and evil, thou shalt not eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely
die.  Gen. 3:6,  17. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of
the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did
eat.… And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of  thy
wife, and hast eaten of  the tree, of  which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
eat of  it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of  it all the days of
thy life.

d.  Rom. 8:7–8. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
subject to the law of  God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh
cannot please God.  John 6:44,  65. No man can come to me, except the Father
which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.… And he said,
Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto
him of  my Father.  John 15:5. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in
me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do noth-
ing.  Rom. 5:5. And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of  God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

e.  Rom. 3:9–10,  12,  23. What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for
we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; as it is
written, There is none righteous, no, not one.… They are all gone out of  the way, they
are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.… For
all have sinned, and come short of  the glory of  God.

f.  Eph. 2:1,  5. And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
sins.… Even when we were dead in sins, [God] hath quickened us together with Christ,
(by grace ye are saved;) …  Col. 2:13. And you, being dead in your sins and the
uncircumcision of  your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven
you all trespasses.

his grace alone, enables him freely to will and to do that which is

you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of  my Father.
John 3:3,  5–6. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Ex-
cept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of  God.… Jesus answered,
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of  water and of  the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of  God. That which is born of  the flesh is flesh; and
that which is born of  the Spirit is spirit.  1 Cor. 2:14. But the natural man receiveth
not the things of  the Spirit of  God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he
know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  Titus 3:3–5. For we ourselves
also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness
and love of  God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of  righteousness
which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of  regen-
eration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost.

h.  Col. 1:13. … who hath delivered us from the power of  darkness, and hath
translated us into the kingdom of  his dear Son.  John 8:34,  36. Jesus answered them,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of  sin.… If  the
Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.  Rom. 6:6–7. … knowing
this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of  sin might be destroyed,
that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin.

i.  Phil. 2:13. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of  his
good pleasure.  Rom. 6:14,  17–19,  22. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for
ye are not under the law, but under grace.… But God be thanked, that ye were the
servants of  sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of  doctrine which was
delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of  righteous-
ness. I speak after the manner of  men because of  the infirmity of  your flesh: for as ye
have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even
so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.… But now being
made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and
the end everlasting life.

k.  Gal. 5:17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that
ye would.  Rom. 7:14–25. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
under sin. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I
hate, that do I. If  then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is
good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that
in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but
how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but
the evil which I would not, that I do. Now if  I do that I would not, it is no more I that

present  with  me.  For  I  delight  in  the  law  of   God  after  the  inward  man:  but  I  see
another law in my members, warring against the law of  my mind, and bringing me
into captivity to the law of  sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am!
who shall deliver me from the body of  this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ
our Lord. So then with the mind I myself  serve the law of  God; but with the flesh the
law of  sin.  1 John 1:8,  10. If  we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
the truth is not in us.… If  we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
word is not in us.

l.  Heb. 12:23. … to the general assembly and church of  the firstborn, which are
written in heaven, and to God the Judge of  all, and to the spirits of  just men made
perfect.  1 John 3:2. Beloved, now are we the sons of  God, and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we
shall see him as he is.  Jude 24. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling,
and to present you faultless before the presence of  his glory with exceeding joy …
Rev. 21:27. And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither
whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the
Lamb’s book of  life.

a.  Acts 13:48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of  the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.  Rom.
8:28,  30. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God,
to them who are the called according to his purpose.… Moreover whom he did pre-
destinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom
he justified, them he also glorified.  Rom. 11:7. What then? Israel hath not obtained
that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.
Eph. 1:5,  11. … having predestinated us unto the adoption of  children by Jesus
Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of  his will.… in whom also we have
obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of  him who
worketh all things after the counsel of  his own will.  2 Tim. 1:9–10. … who hath
saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according
to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of  our Saviour Jesus Christ, who
hath  abolished  death,  and  hath  brought  life  and  immortality  to  light  through  the

b.  2 Thess. 2:13–14. But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you,
brethren beloved of  the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
salvation through sanctification of  the Spirit and belief  of  the truth: whereunto he
called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of  the glory of  our Lord Jesus Christ.  James
1:18. Of  his own will begat he us with the word of  truth, that we should be a kind of
firstfruits of  his creatures.  2 Cor. 3:3,  6. Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to
be the epistle of  Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of  the
living God; not in tables of  stone, but in fleshy tables of  the heart.… who also hath
made us able ministers of  the new testament; not of  the letter, but of  the spirit: for the
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.  1 Cor. 2:12. Now we have received, not the
spirit of  the world, but the spirit which is of  God; that we might know the things that
are freely given to us of  God.

c.  2 Tim. 1:9–10. … who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given
us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing
of  our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and
immortality to light through the gospel.  1 Pet. 2:9. But ye are a chosen generation, a
royal  priesthood,  an  holy  nation,  a  peculiar  people;  that  ye  should  shew  forth  the
praises of  him who hath called you out of  darkness into his marvellous light.  Rom.
8:2. For the law of  the Spirit of  life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of
sin and death.  Eph. 2:1–10. And you hath he quickened, who were dead in tres-
passes and sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of  this world,
according to the prince of  the power of  the air, the spirit that now worketh in the
children of  disobedience: among whom also we all had our conversation in times past
in the lusts of  our flesh, fulfilling the desires of  the flesh and of  the mind; and were by
nature the children of  wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his
great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us
together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made
us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might
shew the exceeding riches of  his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of  yourselves: it is the gift of  God:
not of  works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
d.  Acts 26:18. [I send thee] to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness
to light, and from the power of  Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.  1 Cor.
2:10,  12. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all
things, yea, the deep things of  God.… Now we have received, not the spirit of  the
world, but the spirit which is of  God; that we might know the things that are freely
given to us of  God.  Eph. 1:17–18. … that the God of  our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of  glory, may give unto you the spirit of  wisdom and revelation in the knowl-

ing  them  to  that  which  is  good,f  and  effectually  drawing  them  to
Jesus Christ:g yet so, as they come most freely, being made willing by
his grace.h

2.  This effectual call is of  God’s free and special grace alone, not

edge of  him: the eyes of  your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know
what is the hope of  his calling, and what the riches of  the glory of  his inheritance in
the saints.  2 Cor. 4:6. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of  darkness,
hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of  the knowledge of  the glory of  God in the
face of  Jesus Christ.

e.  Ezek. 36:26. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
you: and I will take away the stony heart out of  your flesh, and I will give you an heart
of  flesh.

f.  Ezek. 11:19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within
you; and I will take the stony heart out of  their flesh, and will give them an heart of
flesh.  Deut. 30:6. And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart
of  thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that
thou mayest live.  Ezek. 36:27. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to
walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.  John 3:5. Jesus
answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of  water and of  the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of  God.  Titus 3:5. Not by works of  righ-
teousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing
of  regeneration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost.  1 Pet. 1:23. … being born again,
not of  corruptible seed, but of  incorruptible, by the word of  God, which liveth and
abideth for ever.

g.  John 6:44–45. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they
shall be all taught of  God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of
the Father, cometh unto me.  Acts 16:14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller
of  purple, of  the city of  Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the
Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of  Paul.

h.  Ps. 110:3. Thy people shall be willing in the day of  thy power, in the beauties
of  holiness from the womb of  the morning: thou hast the dew of  thy youth.  John
6:37. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will
in no wise cast out.  Matt. 11:28. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.  Rev. 22:17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.
And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever
will, let him take the water of  life freely.  Rom. 6:16–18. Know ye not, that to whom
ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of
sin unto death, or of  obedience unto righteousness? But God be thanked, that ye were
the servants of  sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of  doctrine which was
delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of  righteous-
ness.  Eph. 2:8. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of  yourselves: it
is the gift of  God.  Phil. 1:29. For unto you it is given in the behalf  of  Christ, not only
to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.

through faith; and that not of  yourselves: it is the gift of  God: not of  works, lest any
man should boast.  Rom. 9:11. … (for the children being not yet born, neither hav-
ing done any good or evil, that the purpose of  God according to election might stand,
not of  works, but of  him that calleth;) …

k.  1 Cor. 2:14. But the natural man receiveth not the things of  the Spirit of  God:
for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritu-
ally discerned.  Rom. 8:7–9. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is
not subject to the law of  God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh
cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if  so be that the Spirit
of  God dwell in you. Now if  any man have not the Spirit of  Christ, he is none of  his.
Titus 3:4–5. But after that the kindness and love of  God our Saviour toward man
appeared, not by works of  righteousness which we have done, but according to his
mercy he saved us, by the washing of  regeneration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost.
l.    John  6:37.  All  that  the  Father  giveth  me  shall  come  to  me;  and  him  that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  Ezek. 36:27. And I will put my spirit within
you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do
them.  1 John 5:1. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of  God: and
every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of  him.  Cf.
1 John 3:9.

m.  Gen. 17:7. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee,
and to thy seed after thee.  Luke 18:15–16. And they brought unto him also infants,
that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus
called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not: for of  such is the kingdom of  God.  Acts 2:39. For the promise is unto you,
and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God
shall call.  John 3:3,  5. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of  God.… Jesus an-
swered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of  water and of  the Spirit,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of  God.  1 John 5:12. He that hath the Son hath

righteousness, and of  judgment.  1 John 5:12. He that hath the Son hath life; and he
that hath not the Son of  God hath not life.  Acts 4:12. Neither is there salvation in
any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we

p.  Matt. 13:14–15. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of  Esaias, which saith,
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall
not perceive.  Acts 28:24. And some believed the things which were spoken, and
some believed not.  Cf. Acts 13:48.  Matt. 22:14. For many are called, but few are
chosen.

q.  Matt. 13:20–21. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is
he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not root in him-
self, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of  the
word, by and by he is offended.  Matt. 7:22. Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and
in thy name done many wonderful works?  Heb. 6:4–5. For it is impossible for those
who were once enlightened, and have tasted of  the heavenly gift, and were made
partakers of  the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of  God, and the powers
of  the world to come …

r.  John 6:37,  64–66. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him
that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.… But there are some of  you that believe
not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who
should betray him. And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come
unto me, except it were given unto him of  my Father. From that time many of  his
disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  John 8:44. Ye are of  your father
the devil, and the lusts of  your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the begin-
ning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh
a lie, he speaketh of  his own: for he is a liar, and the father of  it.  John 13:18. I speak
not of  you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He
that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.  Cf. John 17:12.

transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of  Christ, hath not God. He that abideth
in the doctrine of  Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.  John 14:6. Jesus saith
unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by
me.  Eph. 2:12–13. … that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the
commonwealth of  Israel, and strangers from the covenants of  promise, having no
hope, and without God in the world: but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were
far off  are made nigh by the blood of  Christ.  John 4:22. Ye worship ye know not
what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of  the Jews.  John 17:3. And this is
life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou
hast sent.  Rom. 10:13–17. For whosoever shall call upon the name of  the Lord shall
be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how
shall  they  believe  in  him  of   whom  they  have  not  heard?  and  how  shall  they  hear
without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
How beautiful are the feet of  them that preach the gospel of  peace, and bring glad
tidings of  good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord,
who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
word of  God.

t.  2 John 9–11. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of  Christ, he hath both the
Father and the Son. If  there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth him God
speed is partaker of  his evil deeds.  1 Cor. 16:22. If  any man love not the Lord Jesus
Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.  Gal. 1:6–8. I marvel that ye are so soon
removed from him that called you into the grace of  Christ unto another gospel: which
is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of
Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you
than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

a.  Rom. 8:30. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
Rom. 3:24. … being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
Christ Jesus.  Rom. 5:15–16. But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
through the offence of  one many be dead, much more the grace of  God, and the gift
by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as it
was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation,
but the free gift is of  many offences unto justification.

and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous; not for
anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ’s sake
alone; nor by imputing faith itself, the act of  believing, or any other
evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imput-
ing the obedience and satisfaction of  Christ unto them,b they receiv-
ing and resting on him and his righteousness, by faith; which faith
they have not of  themselves, it is the gift of  God.c

b.  Rom. 4:5–8. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also describeth the
blessedness of  the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, say-
ing, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed
is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Cometh this blessedness then upon
the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reck-
oned to Abraham for righteousness.  2 Cor. 5:19,  21. … to wit, that God was in
Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them;
and hath committed unto us the word of  reconciliation.… For he hath made him to
be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of  God in
him.  Rom. 3:22–28. … even the righteousness of  God which is by faith of  Jesus
Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have
sinned, and come short of  the glory of  God; being justified freely by his grace through
the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of  sins that are
past, through the forbearance of  God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness:
that he might be just, and the justifier of  him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boast-
ing then? It is excluded. By what law? of  works? Nay: but by the law of  faith. There-
fore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of  the law.  Titus
3:5,  7. Not by works of  righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy
he saved us, by the washing of  regeneration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost;… that
being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of  eternal
life.  Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins, according to the riches of  his grace.  Jer. 23:6. In his days Judah shall be saved,
and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE
LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.  1 Cor. 1:30–31. But of  him are ye in Christ
Jesus, who of  God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
redemption: that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
Rom. 5:17–19. … (For if  by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more
they which receive abundance of  grace and of  the gift of  righteousness shall reign in
life by one, Jesus Christ.) therefore as by the offence of  one judgment came upon all
men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of  one the free gift came upon all
men  unto  justification  of   life.  For  as  by  one  man’s  disobedience  many  were  made
sinners, so by the obedience of  one shall many be made righteous.

c.  John 1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of  God, even to them that believe on his name.  Acts 10:43. To him give all the
prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive re-
mission of  sins.  Acts 13:38–39. Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren,

2.  Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteous-
ness, is the alone instrument of  justification:d yet is it not alone in the
person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces,
and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.e

3.  Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the
debt of  all those that are thus justified, and did make a proper, real,
and full satisfaction to his Father’s justice in their behalf.f Yet, inas-

that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of  sins: and by him all that
believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of
Moses.  Phil. 3:9. … and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which
is of  the law, but that which is through the faith of  Christ, the righteousness which is of
God by faith.  Eph. 2:7–8. … that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding
riches of  his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye
saved through faith; and that not of  yourselves: it is the gift of  God.  John 6:44–45,
65. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I
will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all
taught of  God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of  the Father,
cometh unto me.… And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come
unto me, except it were given unto him of  my Father.  Phil. 1:29. For unto you it is
given in the behalf  of  Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.
d.  John 3:18,  36. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of  the only begot-
ten Son of  God.… He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of  God abideth on him.  Rom.
3:28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of  the
law.  Rom. 5:1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ.

e.  James 2:17,  22,  26. Even so faith, if  it hath not works, is dead, being alone.…
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?…
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.  Gal.
5:6. For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision;
but faith which worketh by love.

f.  Mark 10:45. For even the Son of  man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  Rom. 5:8–10,  18–19. But God
commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through
him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of  his Son,
much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.… Therefore as by the
offence of  one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righ-
teousness of  one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of  life. For as by one
man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of  one shall many
be made righteous.  Gal. 3:13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of  the law,
being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.
1  Tim.  2:5–6.  For  there  is  one  God,  and  one  mediator  between  God  and  men,
the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself  a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

much as he was given by the Father for them;g and his obedience and
satisfaction accepted in their stead;h and both, freely, not for any-
thing in them; their justification is only of  free grace;i that both the
exact justice and rich grace of  God might be glorified in the justifica-
tion of  sinners.k

Heb. 1:3. … who being the brightness of  his glory, and the express image of  his
person, and upholding all things by the word of  his power, when he had by himself
purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of  the Majesty on high.  Heb. 10:10,  14.
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of  the body of  Jesus Christ
once for all.… For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
Dan. 9:24,  26. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of  sins, and to make reconciliation
for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.… And after threescore and two weeks shall
Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of  the prince that shall come
shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof  shall be with a flood, and
unto the end of  the war desolations are determined.  See Isa. 52:13–53:12.

g.  Rom. 8:32. He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  John 3:16. For God so loved
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life.

h.  2 Cor. 5:21. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
might be made the righteousness of  God in him.  Eph. 5:2. … and walk in love, as
Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself  for us an offering and a sacrifice to
God for a sweetsmelling savour.  Phil. 2:6–9. … who, being in the form of  God,
thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself  of  no reputation, and
took upon him the form of  a servant, and was made in the likeness of  men: and being
found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
even the death of  the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given
him a name which is above every name.  Isa. 53:10–11. Yet it pleased the LORD to
bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin,
he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of  the LORD shall
prosper in his hand. He shall see of  the travail of  his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his
knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
i.  Rom. 3:24. … being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that
is in Christ Jesus.  Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of  sins, according to the riches of  his grace.

k.  Rom. 3:26. … to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be
just, and the justifier of  him which believeth in Jesus.  Eph. 2:7. … that in the ages to
come he might shew the exceeding riches of  his grace in his kindness toward us through
Christ Jesus.  Zech. 9:9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of  Zion; shout, O daughter of
Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly,
and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of  an ass.  Isa. 45:21. Tell ye, and
bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from
ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no
God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.

4.  God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect,l and
Christ did, in the fullness of  time, die for their sins, and rise again for
their justification:m nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy
Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them.n

5.  God doth continue to forgive the sins of  those that are justified;o
and, although they can never fall from the state of  justification,p yet

l.  Rom. 8:29–30. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of  his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many breth-
ren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called,
them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  Gal. 3:8. And
the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached
before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.  1 Pet.
1:2,   19–20.  …  elect  according  to  the  foreknowledge  of   God  the  Father,  through
sanctification of  the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of  the blood of  Jesus Christ:
Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.… But [ye were redeemed] with the pre-
cious blood of  Christ, as of  a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was
foreordained before the foundation of  the world, but was manifest in these last times
for you.

m.  Gal. 4:4. But when the fulness of  the time was come, God sent forth his Son,
made of  a woman, made under the law.  1 Tim. 2:6. … who gave himself  a ransom
for all, to be testified in due time.  Rom. 4:25. … who was delivered for our offences,
and was raised again for our justification.

n.  Eph. 2:3. … among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
the lusts of  our flesh, fulfilling the desires of  the flesh and of  the mind; and were by
nature the children of  wrath, even as others.  Titus 3:3–7. For we ourselves also were
sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in
malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love
of  God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of  righteousness which we
have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of  regeneration,
and renewing of  the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ
our Saviour; that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to
the hope of  eternal life.  Gal. 2:16. … knowing that a man is not justified by the
works of  the law, but by the faith of  Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ,
that we might be justified by the faith of  Christ, and not by the works of  the law: for by
the works of  the law shall no flesh be justified.  Cf. Col. 1:21–22.

o.  Matt. 6:12. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  1 John 1:7,  9.
But if  we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
and the blood of  Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.… If  we confess our
sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteous-
ness.  1 John 2:1–2. My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
And if  any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of  the
whole world.

p.    Rom.  5:1–5. Therefore  being  justified  by  faith,  we  have  peace  with  God
through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace

they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not
have  the  light  of   his  countenance  restored  unto  them,  until  they
humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their
faith and repentance.q

6.  The justification of  believers under the old testament was, in
all these respects, one and the same with the justification of  believers

wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of  the glory of  God. And not only so, but we
glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience,
experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of
God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.  Rom.
8:30–39. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. What shall
we then say to these things? If  God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
give us all things? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of  God’s elect? It is God that
justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen
again, who is even at the right hand of  God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who
shall separate us from the love of  Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed
all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we
are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
from the love of  God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Heb. 10:14. For by one
offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  Cf. Luke 22:32; John
10:28.

q.  Ps. 89:30–33. If  his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
if  they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their
transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my lovingkind-
ness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.  Ps. 51. Have
mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multi-
tude of  thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine
iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin
is ever before me.… Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me.… Restore unto me the joy of  thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free
spirit.…  Ps. 32:5. I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the
iniquity of  my sin. Selah.  Matt. 26:75. And Peter remembered the word of  Jesus,
which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went
out, and wept bitterly.  Luke 1:20. And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to
speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not
my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.  1 Cor. 11:30,  32. For this cause
many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.… But when we are judged, we
are chastened of  the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

Chapter 12
Of  Adoption

1.  All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his
only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of  the grace of  adoption,a
by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and
privileges of  the children of  God,b have his name put upon them,c

r.  Gal.  3:9,   13–14. So then they which be of  faith are blessed with faithful
Abraham.… Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of  the law, being made a curse
for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: that the blessing of
Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the
promise of  the Spirit through faith.  Rom. 4:6–8,  22–24. Even as David also describeth
the blessedness of  the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.… And therefore it was
imputed to him for righteousness. Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was
imputed to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if  we believe on him that
raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.  Rom. 10:6–13. But the righteousness which
is of  faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?
(that is, to bring Christ down from above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that
is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee,
even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of  faith, which we preach; that if
thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that
God  hath  raised  him  from  the  dead,  thou  shalt  be  saved.  For  with  the  heart  man
believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is
no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all
that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of  the Lord shall be saved.
Heb. 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

a.  Eph. 1:5. … having predestinated us unto the adoption of  children by Jesus
Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of  his will.  Gal. 4:4–5. But when
the fulness of  the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of  a woman, made
under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of  sons.

b.  Rom. 8:17. … and if  children, then heirs; heirs of  God, and joint-heirs with
Christ; if  so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  John
1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
God, even to them that believe on his name.

resurrection,a by his Word and Spirit dwelling in them:b the domin-

a.  1 Thess. 5:23–24. And the very God of  peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.  2 Thess.
2:13–14. But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of
the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanc-
tification of  the Spirit and belief  of  the truth: whereunto he called you by our gospel,
to the obtaining of  the glory of  our Lord Jesus Christ.  Ezek. 36:22–28. Therefore
say unto the house of  Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O
house of  Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the
heathen, whither ye went. And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned
among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of  them; and the heathen
shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you
before their eyes. For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of
all countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then will I sprinkle clean water
upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I
cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and
I will take away the stony heart out of  your flesh, and I will give you an heart of  flesh.
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall
keep my judgments, and do them. And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your
fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  Titus 3:5. Not by works
of  righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the
washing of  regeneration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost.  Acts 20:32. And now,
brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of  his grace, which is able to build
you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.  Phil.
3:10. … that I may know him, and the power of  his resurrection, and the fellowship
of  his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.  Rom. 6:5–6. For if  we
have been planted together in the likeness of  his death, we shall be also in the likeness
of  his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body
of  sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

b.  John 17:17,  19. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.… And for
their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.  Eph.
5:26. … that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of  water by the word.
Rom. 8:13–14. For if  ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if  ye through the Spirit
do mortify the deeds of  the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of
God, they are the sons of  God.  2 Thess. 2:13. But we are bound to give thanks
alway  to  God  for  you,  brethren  beloved  of   the  Lord,  because  God  hath  from  the
beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of  the Spirit and belief  of
the truth.

are more and more weakened and mortified;d and they more and
more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces,e to the prac-
tice of  true holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.f

perfect in this life, there abiding still some remnants of  corruption in
every part;h whence ariseth a continual and irreconcilable war, the

c.  Rom. 6:6,  14. … knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that
the body of  sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.… For sin
shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.

d.  Gal. 5:24. And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affec-
tions and lusts.  Rom. 8:13. For if  ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if  ye through
the Spirit do mortify the deeds of  the body, ye shall live.

e.  Col. 1:10–11. … that ye might walk worthy of  the Lord unto all pleasing,
being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of  God; strength-
ened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering
with joyfulness.  Eph. 3:16–19. … that he would grant you, according to the riches
of  his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ
may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be
able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
height; and to know the love of  Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be
filled with all the fulness of God.

f.  2 Cor. 7:1. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of  the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of
God.  Col. 1:28. … whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man
in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.  Col. 4:12.
Epaphras, who is one of  you, a servant of  Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fer-
vently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of  God.
Heb. 12:14. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see
the Lord.

g.  1 Thess. 5:23. And the very God of  peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ.  Rom. 12:1–2. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mer-
cies of  God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye trans-
formed  by  the  renewing  of   your  mind,  that  ye  may  prove  what  is  that  good,  and
acceptable, and perfect, will of  God.

h.  1 John 1:8–10. If  we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us. If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If  we say that we have not sinned, we make him
a liar, and his word is not in us.  Rom. 7:14–25. For we know that the law is spiritual:
but I am carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that
do I not; but what I hate, that do I.… For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,)
dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which
is good I find not.… O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of

may much prevail;k yet, through the continual supply of  strength from
the sanctifying Spirit of  Christ, the regenerate part doth overcome;l
and so, the saints grow in grace,m perfecting holiness in the fear of
God.n

Chapter 14

Of  Saving Faith

1.  The grace of  faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to
the saving of  their souls,a is the work of  the Spirit of  Christ in their

this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself
serve the law of  God; but with the flesh the law of  sin.  Phil. 3:12. Not as though I
had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if  that I may ap-
prehend that for which also I am apprehended of  Christ Jesus.

i.  Gal. 5:17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that
ye would.

k.  Rom. 7:23. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of

my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of  sin which is in my members.

l.  Rom. 6:14. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
law, but under grace.  1 John 5:4. For whatsoever is born of  God overcometh the
world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.  Eph. 4:15–
16. … but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the
head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of
every part, maketh increase of  the body unto the edifying of  itself  in love.  See Rom.
8:2.

m.  2 Pet. 3:18. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of  our Lord and Sav-
iour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.  2 Cor. 3:18. But we
all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of  the Lord, are changed into the
same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of  the Lord.

n.  2 Cor. 7:1. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of  the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of
God.

a.  Titus 1:1. Paul, a servant of  God, and an apostle of  Jesus Christ, according to
the faith of  God’s elect, and the acknowledging of  the truth which is after godliness.
Heb. 10:39. But we are not of  them who draw back unto perdition; but of  them that

hearts,b and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of  the Word,c by
which also, and by the administration of  the sacraments, and prayer,
it is increased and strengthened.d

b.  1 Cor. 12:3. Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
Spirit of  God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord,
but  by  the  Holy  Ghost.    John  3:5.  Jesus  answered, Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  thee,
Except a man be born of  water and of  the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.  Titus 3:5. Not by works of  righteousness which we have done, but according
to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of  regeneration, and renewing of  the Holy
Ghost.  John 6:44–45,  65. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath
sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets,
And they shall be all taught of  God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath
learned of  the Father, cometh unto me.… And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that
no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of  my Father.  Eph. 2:8.
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of  yourselves: it is the gift of  God.
Phil. 1:29. For unto you it is given in the behalf  of  Christ, not only to believe on him,
but also to suffer for his sake.  2 Pet. 1:1. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of
Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righ-
teousness of  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.  See 1 Pet. 1:2.

c.  Matt. 28:19–20. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto
the end of  the world. Amen.  Rom. 10:14,  17. How then shall they call on him in
whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of  whom they have
not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher.… So then faith cometh by
hearing, and hearing by the word of  God.  1 Cor. 1:21. For after that in the wisdom
of  God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of
preaching to save them that believe.

d.  1 Pet. 2:2. As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of  the word, that ye may
grow thereby.  Acts 20:32. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the
word of  his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among
all them which are sanctified.  Rom. 1:16–17. For I am not ashamed of  the gospel of
Christ: for it is the power of  God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew
first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of  God revealed from faith
to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and
teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the
Holy Ghost.  See Acts 2:38.  1 Cor. 10:16. The cup of  blessing which we bless, is it
not the communion of  the blood of  Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the
communion of  the body of  Christ?  1 Cor. 11:23–29. For I have received of  the
Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which
he was betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of  me.
After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is
the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me.
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he
come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of  the Lord, un-

2.  By this faith, a Christian believeth to be true whatsoever is
revealed  in  the  Word,  for  the  authority  of   God  himself   speaking
therein;e and acteth differently upon that which each particular pas-
sage thereof  containeth; yielding obedience to the commands,f trem-
bling at the threatenings,g and embracing the promises of  God for
this life, and that which is to come.h But the principal acts of  saving

worthily, shall be guilty of  the body and blood of  the Lord. But let a man examine
himself, and so let him eat of  that bread, and drink of  that cup. For he that eateth and
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the
Lord’s body.  Luke 17:5. And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
Phil. 4:6–7. Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of  God,
which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
e.  2 Pet. 1:20–21. … knowing this first, that no prophecy of  the scripture is of
any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of  man:
but holy men of  God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.  John 4:42. And
[they] said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of  thy saying: for we have
heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of  the world.
1 Thess. 2:13. For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye
received the word of  God which ye heard of  us, ye received it not as the word of  men,
but as it is in truth, the word of  God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
1 John 5:9–10. If  we receive the witness of  men, the witness of  God is greater: for
this is the witness of  God which he hath testified of  his Son. He that believeth on the
Son of  God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a
liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of  his Son.  Acts 24:14. But
this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God
of  my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets.

f.  Ps. 119:10–11,  48,  97–98,  167–168. With my whole heart have I sought
thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. Thy word have I hid in mine
heart, that I might not sin against thee.… My hands also will I lift up unto thy com-
mandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.… O how love I thy
law! it is my meditation all the day. Thou through thy commandments hast made me
wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.… My soul hath kept thy testimo-
nies; and I love them exceedingly. I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all
my ways are before thee.  John 14:15. If  ye love me, keep my commandments.

g.  Ezra 9:4. Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words
of  the God of  Israel, because of  the transgression of  those that had been carried
away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.  Isa. 66:2. For all those things
hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man
will I look, even to him that is poor and of  a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
Heb. 4:1. Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of  entering into his rest,
any of  you should seem to come short of  it.

h.  Heb. 11:13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of  them, and embraced them, and
confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  1 Tim. 4:8. For bodily
exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of

faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for justi-
fication, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of  the covenant of
grace.i

3.  This faith is different in degrees, weak or strong;k may be often
and many ways assailed, and weakened, but gets the victory:l grow-
ing up in many to the attainment of  a full assurance, through Christ,m

the life that now is, and of  that which is to come.

i.  John 1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of  God, even to them that believe on his name.  Acts 16:31. And they said,
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  Gal. 2:20.
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the
life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of  the Son of  God, who loved me,
and gave himself  for me.  Acts 15:11. But we believe that through the grace of  the
Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.  2 Tim. 1:9–10. … who hath saved
us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
but is now made manifest by the appearing of  our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath
abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.

k.  Heb. 5:13–14. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of  righ-
teousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of  full age, even
those who by reason of  use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
Rom. 14:1–2. Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputa-
tions. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
Matt. 6:30. Wherefore, if  God so clothe the grass of  the field, which to day is, and to
morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of  little faith?
Rom. 4:19–20. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of  Sarah’s
womb: he staggered not at the promise of  God through unbelief; but was strong in
faith, giving glory to God.  Matt. 8:10. When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said
to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in
Israel.

l.  Luke 22:31–32. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath de-
sired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy
faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.  Eph. 6:16.
… above all, taking the shield of  faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of  the wicked.  1 John 5:4–5. For whatsoever is born of  God overcometh
the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he
that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of  God?

m.  Heb. 6:11–12. And we desire that every one of  you do shew the same dili-
gence to the full assurance of  hope unto the end: that ye be not slothful, but followers
of  them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  Heb. 10:22. Let us
draw near with a true heart in full assurance of  faith, having our hearts sprinkled from
an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.  Col. 2:2. … that their
hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of  the full
assurance of  understanding, to the acknowledgement of  the mystery of  God, and of

Of  Repentance unto Life

1.    Repentance  unto  life  is  an  evangelical  grace,a  the  doctrine
whereof  is to be preached by every minister of  the gospel, as well as
that of  faith in Christ.b

2.  By it, a sinner, out of  the sight and sense not only of  the dan-
ger, but also of  the filthiness and odiousness of  his sins, as contrary to
the holy nature, and righteous law of  God; and upon the apprehen-
sion of  his mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, so grieves for, and
hates his sins, as to turn from them all unto God,c purposing and

n.  Heb. 12:2. … looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of  our faith; who for
the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down
at the right hand of  the throne of  God.

a.  Acts 11:18. When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified
God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.  2 Cor.
7:10. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the
sorrow of  the world worketh death.  Zech. 12:10. And I will pour upon the house of
David, and upon the inhabitants of  Jerusalem, the spirit of  grace and of  supplications:
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him,
as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in
bitterness for his firstborn.

b.  Luke 24:47. … and that repentance and remission of  sins should be preached
in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.  Mark 1:15. … and saying,
The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of  God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the
gospel.  Acts 20:21. … testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

c.  Ezek. 18:30–31. Therefore I will judge you, O house of  Israel, every one
according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your
transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your trans-
gressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit:
for why will ye die, O house of  Israel?  Ezek. 36:31. Then shall ye remember your
own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your
own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.  Isa. 30:22. Ye shall defile
also the covering of  thy graven images of  silver, and the ornament of  thy molten
images of  gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it,
Get thee hence.  Ps. 51:4. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou
judgest.  Jer. 31:18–19. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself  thus; Thou
hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn

3.  Although repentance be not to be rested in, as any satisfaction
for sin, or any cause of  the pardon thereof,e which is the act of  God’s
free  grace  in  Christ;f  yet  it  is  of   such  necessity  to  all  sinners,  that
none may expect pardon without it.g

thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.  Joel 2:12–13. There-
fore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting,
and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart, and not your garments,
and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and
of  great kindness, and repenteth him of  the evil.  Amos 5:15. Hate the evil, and love
the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of  hosts
will be gracious unto the remnant of  Joseph.  Ps. 119:128. Therefore I esteem all thy
precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  2 Cor. 7:11. For
behold  this  selfsame  thing,  that  ye  sorrowed  after  a  godly  sort,  what  carefulness  it
wrought in you, yea, what clearing of  yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what
fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have
approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.  1 Thess. 1:9. For they themselves
shew of  us what manner of  entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God
from idols to serve the living and true God.

d.  Ps. 119:6,  59,  106. Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto
all thy commandments.… I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimo-
nies.… I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
2 Kings 23:25. And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the
LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all
the law of  Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.  See Luke 1:6.

e.  Ezek. 36:31–32. Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your do-
ings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities
and for your abominations. Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it
known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of  Israel.
Ezek. 16:61–63. Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for
daughters, but not by thy covenant. And I will establish my covenant with thee; and
thou shalt know that I am the LORD: that thou mayest remember, and be confounded,
and never open thy mouth any more because of  thy shame, when I am pacified to-
ward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.  Isa. 43:25. I, even I, am
he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy
sins.

f.  Hos. 14:2,  4. Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of  our lips.…
I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from
him.  Rom. 3:24. … being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is
in Christ Jesus.  Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of  sins, according to the riches of  his grace.

4.  As there is no sin so small, but it deserves damnation;h so there
is no sin so great, that it can bring damnation upon those who truly
repent.i

5.  Men ought not to content themselves with a general repen-
tance, but it is every man’s duty to endeavor to repent of  his particu-
lar sins, particularly.k

6.  As every man is bound to make private confession of  his sins to
God, praying for the pardon thereof;l upon which, and the forsaking

remission of  sins.  Acts 17:30–31. And the times of  this ignorance God winked at;
but now commandeth all men every where to repent: because he hath appointed a
day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath
ordained; whereof  he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him
from the dead.

h.  Rom. 6:23. For the wages of  sin is death; but the gift of  God is eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Gal. 3:10. For as many as are of  the works of  the law
are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
things which are written in the book of  the law to do them.  Matt. 12:36. But I say
unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof  in
the day of  judgment.

i.  Isa. 55:7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon.  Rom. 8:1. There is therefore now no condemnation
to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Isa. 1:16–18. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of  your doings from
before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the op-
pressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reason to-
gether, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

k.  Ps. 19:13. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not
have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great
transgression.  Matt. 26:75. And Peter remembered the word of  Jesus, which said
unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.  Luke 19:8. And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the
half  of  my goods I give to the poor; and if  I have taken any thing from any man by
false accusation, I restore him fourfold.  1 Tim. 1:13,  15. … who was before a blas-
phemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it igno-
rantly in unbelief.… This is a faithful saying, and worthy of  all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of  whom I am chief.

l.  Ps. 32:5–6. I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the
iniquity of  my sin. Selah. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of  great waters they shall not come
nigh unto him.  Ps. 51:1–14. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-
kindness: according unto the multitude of  thy tender mercies blot out my transgres-
sions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I ac-

of  them, he shall find mercy;m so, he that scandalizeth his brother, or
the church of  Christ, ought to be willing, by a private or public con-
fession, and sorrow for his sin, to declare his repentance to those that
are offended,n who are thereupon to be reconciled to him, and in
love to receive him.o

Chapter 16

Of  Good Works

1.  Good works are only such as God hath commanded in his holy
Word,a and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by
men, out of  blind zeal, or upon any pretense of  good intention.b

knowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.… Hide thy face from my
sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.… Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou
God of  my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of  thy righteousness.

m.  Prov. 28:13. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth
and forsaketh them shall have mercy.  Isa. 55:7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and
the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have
mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.  1 John 1:9. If  we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.

n.  James 5:16. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of  a righteous man availeth much.
Luke 17:3–4. Take heed to yourselves: If  thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke
him; and if  he repent, forgive him. And if  he trespass against thee seven times in a day,
and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
Josh. 7:19. And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD
God of  Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done;
hide it not from me.  See Matt. 18:15–18.

o.  2 Cor. 2:7–8. So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. Where-
fore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.  See Gal. 6:1–2.

a.  Mic. 6:8. He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
LORD require of  thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
God?  Rom. 12:2. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of  your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and
perfect, will of  God.  Heb. 13:21. … make you perfect in every good work to do his
will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to
whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

b.  Matt. 15:9. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the com-
mandments of  men.  Isa. 29:13. Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people
draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed

2.  These good works, done in obedience to God’s command-
ments, are the fruits and evidences of  a true and lively faith:c and by
them  believers  manifest  their  thankfulness,d  strengthen  their
assurance,e edify their brethren,f adorn the profession of  the gospel,g

their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of  men …
1 Pet. 1:18. … forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your
fathers.  John 16:2. They shall put you out of  the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.  Rom. 10:2. For I
bear  them  record  that  they  have  a  zeal  of   God,  but  not  according  to  knowledge.
1 Sam. 15:21–23. But the people took of  the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief  of  the
things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in
Gilgal. And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacri-
fices, as in obeying the voice of  the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and
to hearken than the fat of  rams. For rebellion is as the sin of  witchcraft, and stubborn-
ness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of  the LORD, he
hath also rejected thee from being king.  Deut. 10:12–13. And now, Israel, what doth
the LORD thy God require of  thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his
ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all
thy soul, to keep the commandments of  the LORD, and his statutes, which I command
thee this day for thy good?  Col. 2:16–17,  20–23. Let no man therefore judge you in
meat, or in drink, or in respect of  an holyday, or of  the new moon, or of  the sabbath
days: which are a shadow of  things to come; but the body is of  Christ.… Wherefore if
ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of  the world, why, as though living in the
world, are ye subject to ordinances, (touch not; taste not; handle not; which all are to
perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of  men? Which things
have indeed a shew of  wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of  the
body; not in any honour to the satisfying of  the flesh.

c.  James 2:18,  22. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew
me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.… Seest
thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?

d.  Ps. 116:12–14. What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
me? I will take the cup of  salvation, and call upon the name of  the LORD. I will pay my
vows unto the LORD now in the presence of  all his people.  Col. 3:15–17. And let the
peace of  God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye
thankful. Let the word of  Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and ad-
monishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in
your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.  1 Pet. 2:9. But ye are a
chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should
shew forth the praises of  him who hath called you out of  darkness into his marvellous
light.

e.  1 John 2:3,  5. And hereby we do know that we know him, if  we keep his
commandments.… But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of  God per-
fected: hereby know we that we are in him.  2 Pet. 1:5–10. And beside this, giving all
diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temper-

stop the mouths of  the adversaries,h and glorify God,i whose work-
manship  they  are,  created  in  Christ  Jesus  thereunto,k  that,  having
their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life.l

3.  Their ability to do good works is not at all of  themselves, but
wholly from the Spirit of  Christ.m And that they may be enabled

ance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness broth-
erly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if  these things be in you, and
abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
of  our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather,
brethren,  give  diligence  to  make  your  calling  and  election  sure:  for  if   ye  do  these
things, ye shall never fall.

f.  2 Cor. 9:2. For I know the forwardness of  your mind, for which I boast of  you
to them of  Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked
very many.  Matt. 5:16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.  1 Tim. 4:12. Let no man
despise thy youth; but be thou an example of  the believers, in word, in conversation, in
charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

g.  Titus 2:5,  9–12. … to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
their own husbands, that the word of  God be not blasphemed.… Exhort servants to
be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answer-
ing again; not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doc-
trine of  God our Saviour in all things. For the grace of  God that bringeth salvation
hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.  1 Tim. 6:1. Let as
many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of  all honour,
that the name of  God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.

h.  1 Pet. 2:15. For so is the will of  God, that with well doing ye may put to

silence the ignorance of  foolish men.

i.  1 Pet. 2:12. … having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they
shall behold, glorify God in the day of  visitation.  Phil. 1:11. … being filled with the
fruits of  righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of  God.
John 15:8. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my
disciples.

k.  Eph. 2:10. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good

works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

l.  Rom. 6:22. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,

ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

m.  John 15:4–6. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine,
ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth
much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If  a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and
they are burned.  Rom. 8:4–14. … that the righteousness of  the law might be ful-
filled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For they that are after the

thereunto, beside the graces they have already received, there is re-
quired an actual influence of  the same Holy Spirit, to work in them
to will, and to do, of  his good pleasure:n yet are they not hereupon to
grow negligent, as if  they were not bound to perform any duty unless
upon a special motion of  the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in
stirring up the grace of  God that is in them.o

4.  They who, in their obedience, attain to the greatest height
which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate,
and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of  much

flesh do mind the things of  the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of  the
Spirit.… But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if  so be that the Spirit of  God
dwell in you. Now if  any man have not the Spirit of  Christ, he is none of  his. And if
Christ be in you, the body is dead because of  sin; but the Spirit is life because of
righteousness.… For as many as are led by the Spirit of  God, they are the sons of  God.
Ezek. 36:26–27. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
you: and I will take away the stony heart out of  your flesh, and I will give you an heart
of  flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and
ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

n.  Phil. 2:13. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of  his
good pleasure.  Phil. 4:13. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
me.    2  Cor.  3:5.  Not  that  we  are  sufficient  of   ourselves  to  think  any  thing  as  of
ourselves; but our sufficiency is of  God.  Eph. 3:16. … that he would grant you,
according to the riches of  his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the
inner man.

o.  Phil. 2:12. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with
fear and trembling.  Heb. 6:11–12. And we desire that every one of  you do shew the
same diligence to the full assurance of  hope unto the end: that ye be not slothful, but
followers of  them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  2 Pet. 1:3,  5,
10–11. … according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain
unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of  him that hath called us to glory and
virtue.… And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue
knowledge.… Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
election sure: for if  ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be
ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of  our Lord and Sav-
iour Jesus Christ.   Isa.  64:7. And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that
stirreth up himself  to take hold of  thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast
consumed us, because of  our iniquities.  2 Tim. 1:6. Wherefore I put thee in remem-
brance that thou stir up the gift of  God, which is in thee by the putting on of  my
hands.  Acts 26:6–7. And now I stand and am judged for the hope of  the promise
made of  God unto our fathers: unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving
God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused
of  the Jews.  Jude 20–21. But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of  God, looking for the
mercy of  our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

which in duty they are bound to do.p

5.  We cannot by our best works merit pardon of  sin, or eternal
life at the hand of  God, by reason of  the great disproportion that is
between them and the glory to come; and the infinite distance that is
between  us  and  God,  whom,  by  them,  we  can  neither  profit,  nor
satisfy for the debt of  our former sins,q but when we have done all we

p.  Luke 17:10. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are
commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our
duty to do.  Neh. 13:22. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.
Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the great-
ness of  thy mercy.  Rom. 8:21–25. Because the creature itself  also shall be delivered
from the bondage of  corruption into the glorious liberty of  the children of  God. For
we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of  the Spirit, even we
ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man
seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if  we hope for that we see not, then do we with
patience wait for it.  Gal. 5:17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the
things that ye would.

q.  Rom. 3:20. Therefore by the deeds of  the law there shall no flesh be justified
in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of  sin.  Rom. 4:2,  4,  6. For if  Abraham
were justified by works, he hath whereof  to glory; but not before God.… Now to him
that worketh is the reward not reckoned of  grace, but of  debt.… Even as David also
describeth the blessedness of  the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness with-
out  works.  Eph.  2:8–9.  For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through  faith;  and  that  not  of
yourselves: it is the gift of  God: not of  works, lest any man should boast.  Titus 3:5–
7. Not by works of  righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us, by the washing of  regeneration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost; which he
shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by his
grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of  eternal life.  Rom. 8:18,
22–24.  For  I  reckon  that  the  sufferings  of   this  present  time  are  not  worthy  to  be
compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.… For we know that the whole
creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but
ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of  the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of  our body. For we are
saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet
hope for?  Ps. 16:2. O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
goodness extendeth not to thee.  Job 22:2–3. Can a man be profitable unto God, as
he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ? Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that
thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect?  Job 35:7–8.
If  thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of  thine hand? Thy
wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of
man.

can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants:r and
because, as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit;s and as they
are wrought by us, they are defiled, and mixed with so much weak-
ness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of  God’s
judgment.t

6.    Notwithstanding,  the  persons  of   believers  being  accepted
through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him;u not as
though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable in
God’s sight;w but that he, looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to
accept and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with
many weaknesses and imperfections.x

r.  Luke 17:10. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are
commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our
duty to do.

s.  Rom. 8:13–14. For if  ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if  ye through the
Spirit do mortify the deeds of  the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the
Spirit of  God, they are the sons of  God.  Gal. 5:22–23. But the fruit of  the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against
such there is no law.

t.  Isa. 64:6. But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as
filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us
away.  Gal. 5:17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that
ye would.  Rom. 7:15,  18. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do
I not; but what I hate, that do I.… For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth
no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I
find not.  Ps. 143:2. And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.  Ps. 130:3. If  thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities,
O Lord, who shall stand?

u.  Eph. 1:6. … to the praise of  the glory of  his grace, wherein he hath made us
accepted in the beloved.  1 Pet. 2:5. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual
house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus
Christ.  See Ex. 28:38; Gen. 4:4; Heb. 11:4.

w.  Job 9:20. If  I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if  I say, I am
perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.  Ps. 143:2. And enter not into judgment with
thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.  1 John 1:8. If  we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

x.  Heb. 13:20–21. Now the God of  peace, that brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of  the sheep, through the blood of  the everlasting
covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that
which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.  2 Cor. 8:12. For if  there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according
to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.  Heb. 6:10. For God is not
unrighteous to forget your work and labour of  love, which ye have shewed toward his

both  to  themselves  and  others:y  yet,  because  they  proceed  not

over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of
thy lord.… His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast
been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into
the joy of  thy lord.  1 Cor. 3:14. If  any man’s work abide which he hath built there-
upon, he shall receive a reward.  1 Cor. 4:5. Therefore judge nothing before the time,
until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of  darkness, and
will make manifest the counsels of  the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of
God.

y.  2 Kings 10:30–31. And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done
well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of
Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of  the fourth generation
shall sit on the throne of  Israel. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of  the LORD
God of  Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of  Jeroboam, which
made Israel to sin.  1 Kings 21:27,  29. And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those
words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in
sackcloth, and went softly.… Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself  before me? be-
cause he humbleth himself  before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his
son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.  Luke 6:32–34. For if  ye love them
which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. And if
ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even
the same. And if  ye lend to them of  whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for
sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  Luke 18:2–7. … saying, There
was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: and there was a
widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of  mine adversary. And
he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God,
nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he
bear long with them?  See Rom. 13:4.

z.  Heb. 11:4,  6. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of  his gifts:
and by it he being dead yet speaketh.… But without faith it is impossible to please him:
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of  them
that diligently seek him.  See Gen. 4:3–5.

a.  1 Cor. 13:3. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.  Isa. 1:12.
When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my
courts?

Chapter 17

Of  the Perseverance of  the Saints

1.  They, whom God hath accepted in his Beloved, effectually
called, and sanctified by his Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall
away from the state of  grace, but shall certainly persevere therein to

trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that
they may have glory of  men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.… And
when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray stand-
ing in the synagogues and in the corners of  the streets, that they may be seen of  men.
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.… Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the
hypocrites, of  a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear
unto  men  to  fast.  Verily  I  say  unto  you, They  have  their  reward.   1  Cor.  10:31.
Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of  God.
c.  Prov. 21:27. The sacrifice of  the wicked is abomination: how much more,
when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?  Hag. 2:14. Then answered Haggai, and
said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every
work of  their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.  Titus 1:15. Unto the
pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing
pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.  Amos 5:21–22. I hate, I despise
your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. Though ye offer me
burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard
the peace offerings of  your fat beasts.  Mark  7:6–7. He answered and said unto
them,  Well  hath  Esaias  prophesied  of   you  hypocrites,  as  it  is  written,  This  people
honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit in vain do they
worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of  men.  Hos. 1:4. And the
LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the
blood of  Jezreel upon the house of  Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of  the
house of  Israel.  Rom. 9:16. So then it is not of  him that willeth, nor of  him that
runneth, but of  God that sheweth mercy.  Titus 3:5. Not by works of  righteousness
which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of  regen-
eration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost.

d.  Ps. 14:4. Have all the workers of  iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.  Ps. 36:3. The words of  his
mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off  to be wise, and to do good.  Matt.
25:41–45. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungred,
and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and
ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me

the end, and be eternally saved.a

2.  This perseverance of  the saints depends not upon their own
free will, but upon the immutability of  the decree of  election, flow-
ing from the free and unchangeable love of  God the Father;b upon
the  efficacy  of   the  merit  and  intercession  of   Jesus  Christ,c  the

not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or
athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to
one of  the least of  these, ye did it not to me.  Matt. 23:23. Woe unto you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of  mint and anise and cummin, and have omit-
ted the weightier matters of  the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to
have done, and not to leave the other undone.  See Rom. 1:21–32.

a.  Phil. 1:6. … being confident of  this very thing, that he which hath begun a
good work in you will perform it until the day of  Jesus Christ.  2 Pet. 1:10. Wherefore
the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if  ye do
these things, ye shall never fall.  Rom. 8:28–30. And we know that all things work
together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the
image of  his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover
whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  John 10:28–29. And I give
unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them
out of  my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is
able to pluck them out of  my Father’s hand.  1 John 3:9. Whosoever is born of  God
doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is
born of  God.  1 John 5:18. We know that whosoever is born of  God sinneth not; but
he that is begotten of  God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
1 Pet. 1:5,  9. … who are kept by the power of  God through faith unto salvation
ready to be revealed in the last time.… receiving the end of  your faith, even the salva-
tion of  your souls.

b.  Ps. 89:3–4,  28–33. I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn
unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all
generations. Selah.… My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as
the days of  heaven. If  his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if
they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their trans-
gression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my lovingkindness
will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.  2 Tim. 2:18–19.
… who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already;
and overthrow the faith of  some. Nevertheless the foundation of  God standeth sure,
having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth
the name of  Christ depart from iniquity.  Jer. 31:3. The LORD hath appeared of  old
unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-
kindness have I drawn thee.

c.  Heb. 10:10,  14. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of

abiding  of  the  Spirit,  and  of  the  seed  of  God  within  them,d  and
the nature of  the covenant of  grace:e from all which ariseth also the

the body of  Jesus Christ once for all.… For by one offering he hath perfected for ever
them that are sanctified.  Heb. 13:20–21. Now the God of  peace, that brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of  the sheep, through the blood of
the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working
in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory
for ever and ever. Amen.  Heb. 9:12–15. Neither by the blood of  goats and calves,
but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us. For if  the blood of  bulls and of  goats, and the ashes of  an heifer
sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of  the flesh: how much more shall
the blood of  Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself  without spot to
God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this
cause he is the mediator of  the new testament, that by means of  death, for the re-
demption of  the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are
called might receive the promise of  eternal inheritance.  Rom. 8:33–39. Who shall
lay any thing to the charge of  God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that
condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the
right hand of  God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from
the love of  Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or naked-
ness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we
are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than
conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  John 17:11,  24. And now I am no more in
the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through
thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.…
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that
they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the
foundation of  the world.  Luke 22:32. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.  Heb. 7:25. Wherefore
he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he
ever liveth to make intercession for them.

d.  John 14:16–17. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of  truth; whom the
world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know
him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.  1 John 2:27. But the anointing
which ye have received of  him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach
you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of  all things, and is truth, and is no lie,
and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  1 John 3:9. Whosoever is born
of  God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because
he is born of  God.

e.  Jer. 32:40. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not
turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they
shall not depart from me.  Ps. 89:34–37. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the

certainty and infallibility thereof.f

3.  Nevertheless, they may, through the temptations of  Satan and
of  the world, the prevalency of  corruption remaining in them, and
the neglect of  the means of  their preservation, fall into grievous sins;g
and,  for  a  time,  continue  therein:h  whereby  they  incur  God’s

thing that is gone out of  my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie
unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall
be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.  See
Jer. 31:31–34.

f.  John 6:38–40. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
will of  him that sent me. And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of  all
which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last
day. And this is the will of  him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and
believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
John 10:28. And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither
shall any man pluck them out of  my hand.  2 Thess. 3:3. But the Lord is faithful,
who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.  1 John 2:19. They went out from us,
but they were not of  us; for if  they had been of  us, they would no doubt have contin-
ued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all
of  us.

g.  Ex. 32:21. And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that
thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  Jonah 1:3,  10. But Jonah rose up to flee
unto Tarshish from the presence of  the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found
a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with
them unto Tarshish from the presence of  the LORD.… Then were the men exceed-
ingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he
fled from the presence of  the LORD, because he had told them.  Ps. 51:14. Deliver me
from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of  my salvation: and my tongue shall sing
aloud of  thy righteousness.  Matt. 26:70,  72,  74. But he denied before them all,
saying, I know not what thou sayest.… And again he denied with an oath, I do not
know the man.… Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
And immediately the cock crew.

h.  2 Sam. 12:9,  13. Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of  the
LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast
taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of  the children of
Ammon.… And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan
said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.  Gal. 2:11–
14. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was
to be blamed. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles:
but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which
were of  the circumcision. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch
that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. But when I saw that they
walked not uprightly according to the truth of  the gospel, I said unto Peter before
them all, If  thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of  Gentiles, and not as do the
Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?

lieved me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of  the children of  Israel, therefore ye shall not
bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.  2 Sam. 11:27. And
when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became
his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
Isa. 64:7,  9. And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself  to

our iniquities.… Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever:
behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.

thou hast broken may rejoice.… Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right
spirit within me.… Restore unto me the joy of  thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
free spirit.  Rev. 2:4. Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast
left thy first love.  Matt. 26:75. And Peter remembered the word of  Jesus, which said
unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.

m.  Isa. 63:17. O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened
our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of  thine inheritance.
n.  Ps. 32:3–4. When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned
into the drought of  summer. Selah.  Ps. 51:8. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that
the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.

o.  Gen. 12:10–20. And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down
into Egypt to sojourn there.… And … he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now … it

wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee, thou art my
sister:  that  it  may  be  well  with  me  for  thy  sake;  and  my  soul  shall  live  because  of
thee.… The princes also of  Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh:
and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.… And the LORD plagued Pharaoh
and his house with great plagues because of  Sarai Abram’s wife. And Pharaoh called
Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me.… I might have taken her
to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.…  2 Sam.

Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation

1.  Although hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly
deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of  be-
ing in the favor of  God, and estate of  salvationa (which hope of  theirs
shall perishb): yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him
in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good conscience before him,
may,  in  this  life,  be  certainly  assured  that  they  are  in  the  state  of
grace,c and may rejoice in the hope of  the glory of  God, which hope
shall never make them ashamed.d

2.  This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persua-
sion grounded upon a fallible hope;e but an infallible assurance of

a.  Mic. 3:11. The heads thereof  judge for reward, and the priests thereof  teach
for hire, and the prophets thereof  divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD,
and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.  Deut. 29:19. …
and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of  this curse, that he bless himself  in
his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of  mine heart, to
add drunkenness to thirst.  John 8:41. Ye do the deeds of  your father. Then said they
to him, We be not born of  fornication; we have one Father, even God.

b.  Amos 9:10. All the sinners of  my people shall die by the sword, which say,
The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.  Matt. 7:22–23. Many will say to me in
that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast
out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto
them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

c.  1 John 5:13. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
the Son of  God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on
the name of  the Son of  God.  1 John 2:3. And hereby we do know that we know him,
if  we keep his commandments.  1 John 3:14,  18–19,  21,  24. We know that we have
passed  from  death  unto  life,  because  we  love  the  brethren.  He  that  loveth  not  his
brother abideth in death.… My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue;
but in deed and in truth.… And hereby we know that we are of  the truth, and shall
assure our hearts before him.… Beloved, if  our heart condemn us not, then have we
confidence toward God.… And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him,
and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath
given us.

d.   Rom. 5:2,  5. … by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
we stand, and rejoice in hope of  the glory of  God.… And hope maketh not ashamed;
because the love of  God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
unto us.

e.  Heb. 6:11,  19. And we desire that every one of  you do shew the same dili-
gence to the full assurance of  hope unto the end.… which hope we have as an anchor
of  the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.

faith founded upon the divine truth of  the promises of  salvation,f the
inward evidence of  those graces unto which these promises are made,g
the testimony of  the Spirit of  adoption witnessing with our spirits
that we are the children of  God,h which Spirit is the earnest of  our
inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of  redemption.i

3.  This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of
faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many
difficulties, before he be partaker of  it:k yet, being enabled by the
Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of  God, he may,

f.  Heb. 6:17–18. Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs
of  promise the immutability of  his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two im-
mutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.

g.  2 Pet. 1:4–11. … whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
promises: that by these ye might be partakers of  the divine nature, having escaped the
corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to
your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to tem-
perance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and
to brotherly kindness charity. For if  these things be in you, and abound, they make you
that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of  our Lord Jesus Christ.
But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten
that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to
make your calling and election sure: for if  ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so
an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  1 John 2:3. And hereby we do know that we
know him, if  we keep his commandments.  1  John  3:14. We know that we have
passed  from  death  unto  life,  because  we  love  the  brethren.  He  that  loveth  not  his
brother abideth in death.  2 Cor. 1:12. For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of  our
conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
grace of  God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to
you-ward.

h.  Rom. 8:15–16. For ye have not received the spirit of  bondage again to fear;
but ye have received the Spirit of  adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit
itself  beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of  God.

i.  Eph. 1:13–14. … in whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of
truth, the gospel of  your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed
with that holy Spirit of  promise, which is the earnest of  our inheritance until the
redemption of  the purchased possession, unto the praise of  his glory.  Eph. 4:30.
And grieve not the holy Spirit of  God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of  redemp-
tion.  2 Cor. 1:21–22. Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath
anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of  the Spirit in our
hearts.

k.  1 John 5:13. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
the Son of  God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on
the name of the Son of God.

without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of  ordinary means,
attain thereunto.l And therefore it is the duty of  everyone to give all
diligence to make his calling and election sure,m that thereby his heart
may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in love and
thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties
of  obedience, the proper fruits of  this assurance;n so far is it from
inclining men to looseness.o

l.  1 Cor. 2:12. Now we have received, not the spirit of  the world, but the spirit
which is of  God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of  God.
1 John 4:13. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath
given us of  his Spirit.  Heb. 6:11–12. And we desire that every one of  you do shew
the same diligence to the full assurance of  hope unto the end: that ye be not slothful,
but followers of  them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  Eph.
3:17–18. … that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and
length, and depth, and height.

m.  2 Pet. 1:10. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your

calling and election sure: for if  ye do these things, ye shall never fall.

n.  Rom. 5:1–2,  5. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace
wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of  the glory of  God.… And hope maketh not
ashamed; because the love of  God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
which is given unto us.  Rom. 14:17. For the kingdom of  God is not meat and drink;
but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  Rom. 15:13. Now the God
of   hope  fill  you  with  all  joy  and  peace  in  believing,  that  ye  may  abound  in  hope,
through the power of  the Holy Ghost.  Eph. 1:3–4. Blessed be the God and Father
of  our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of  the
world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.  Ps. 4:6–7.
There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of  thy
countenance upon us.… Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time
that their corn and their wine increased.  Ps. 119:32. I will run the way of  thy com-
mandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.

o.  1 John 2:1–2. My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
And if  any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of  the
whole world.  Rom. 6:1–2. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that
grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
therein?  Titus 2:11–12,  14. For the grace of  God that bringeth salvation hath ap-
peared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.… who gave himself  for us,
that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself  a peculiar people,
zealous of  good works.  2 Cor. 7:1. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved,
let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of  the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in
the fear of  God.  Rom. 8:1,  12. There is therefore now no condemnation to them

4.  True believers may have the assurance of  their salvation divers
ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as, by negligence in pre-
serving of  it, by falling into some special sin which woundeth the
conscience and grieveth the Spirit; by some sudden or vehement temp-
tation, by God’s withdrawing the light of  his countenance, and suf-
fering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and to have no light:p
yet are they never utterly destitute of  that seed of  God, and life of
faith, that love of  Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of  heart,
and conscience of  duty, out of  which, by the operation of  the Spirit,
this assurance may, in due time, be revived;q and by the which, in the
meantime, they are supported from utter despair.r

which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.… There-
fore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  1 John 3:2–3.
Beloved, now are we the sons of  God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but
we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
And  every  man  that  hath  this  hope  in  him  purifieth  himself,  even  as  he  is  pure.
Ps. 130:4. But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.  1 John
1:6–7. If  we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and
do not the truth: but if  we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one
with another, and the blood of  Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

p.  Ps. 51:8,  12,  14. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoice.… Restore unto me the joy of  thy salvation; and uphold
me with thy free spirit.… Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of  my
salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of  thy righteousness.  Eph. 4:30–31. And
grieve not the holy Spirit of  God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of  redemption.
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away
from you, with all malice.  Ps. 77:1–10. I cried unto God with my voice, even unto
God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.… Will the Lord cast off  for ever? and
will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail
for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender
mercies? Selah. And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of  the
right hand of  the most High.  Ps. 31:22. For I said in my haste, I am cut off  from
before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of  my supplications when I
cried unto thee.  Cf. Matt. 26:69–72 and Luke 22:31–34.

q.  1 John 3:9. Whosoever is born of  God doth not commit sin; for his seed
remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of  God.  Luke 22:32. But I
have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen
thy brethren.  Ps. 51:8,  12. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoice.… Restore unto me the joy of  thy salvation; and uphold
me with thy free spirit.  See Ps. 73:15.

r.  Mic. 7:7–9. Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of  my
salvation: my God will hear me. Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I
shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me. I will bear the
indignation of  the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause,

Chapter 19

Of the Law of God

1.  God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of  works, by which he
bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and per-
petual obedience, promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened
death upon the breach of  it, and endued him with power and ability
to keep it.a

and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his
righteousness.  Jer. 32:40. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I
will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts,
that they shall not depart from me.  Isa. 54:7–14. For a small moment have I for-
saken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face
from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith
the LORD thy Redeemer.… For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed;
but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of  my peace be
removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.… In righteousness shalt thou be
established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror;
for it shall not come near thee.  2 Cor. 4:8–10. We are troubled on every side, yet not
distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast
down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of  the Lord
Jesus, that the life also of  Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

a.  Gen. 1:26–27. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our like-
ness: and let them have dominion over the fish of  the sea, and over the fowl of  the air,
and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of  God created he
him; male and female created he them.  Gen. 2:17. But of  the tree of  the knowledge
of  good and evil, thou shalt not eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou
shalt surely die.  Eph. 4:24. … and that ye put on the new man, which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness.  Rom. 2:14–15. For when the Gentiles,
which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not
the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of  the law written in their
hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accus-
ing or else excusing one another. Rom. 10:5. For Moses describeth the righteousness
which is of  the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.  Rom.
5:12,  19. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned … For as by one man’s disobe-
dience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of  one shall many be made
righteous.  Gal. 3:10,  12. For as many as are of  the works of  the law are under the
curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are
written in the book of  the law to do them.… And the law is not of  faith: but, The man
that doeth them shall live in them.  Eccl. 7:29. Lo, this only have I found, that God
hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.

2.  This law, after his fall, continued to be a perfect rule of  righ-
teousness; and, as such, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in
ten commandments, and written in two tables:b the first four com-
mandments containing our duty towards God; and the other six, our
duty to man.c

b.  James 1:25. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of  liberty, and continueth
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of  the work, this man shall be
blessed in his deed.  James 2:8,  10–12. If  ye fulfil the royal law according to the
scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.… For whosoever shall
keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of  all. For he that said, Do
not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if  thou commit no adultery, yet if
thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of  the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that
shall be judged by the law of  liberty.  Rom. 3:19. Now we know that what things
soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.  Rom. 13:8–9. Owe no
man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the
law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal,
Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if  there be any other
commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.  Deut. 5:32. Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your
God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
Deut. 10:4. And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten com-
mandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of  the midst of  the fire
in the day of  the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.  Ex. 34:1. And the
LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of  stone like unto the first: and I will write
upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

c.  Ex. 20:3–17. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make
unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of  any thing that is in heaven above, or
that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow
down thyself  to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God,
visiting the iniquity of  the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth genera-
tion of  them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of  them that love me,
and keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of  the LORD thy God in
vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Remember
the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the
seventh day is the sabbath of  the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor
thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed
the sabbath day, and hallowed it. Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days
may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false wit-
ness against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not
covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.  Matt. 22:37–40. Jesus said unto him,
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all

3.  Beside this law, commonly called moral, God was pleased to
give to the people of  Israel, as a church under age, ceremonial laws,
containing several typical ordinances, partly of  worship, prefiguring
Christ, his graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits;d and partly, hold-
ing forth divers instructions of  moral duties.e All which ceremonial

thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the
law and the prophets.

d.  Heb. 10:1. For the law having a shadow of  good things to come, and not the
very image of  the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by
year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  Gal. 4:1–3. Now I say, That the
heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of  all;
but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of  the father. Even so we,
when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of  the world.  Col.
2:17. … which are a shadow of  things to come; but the body is of  Christ.  Heb. 9:1–
28. Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of  divine service, and a worldly
sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and
the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil,
the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of  all.… Now when these things were thus
ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service
of  God. But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without
blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of  the people: the Holy Ghost
this signifying, that the way into the holiest of  all was not yet made manifest, while as
the first tabernacle was yet standing: which was a figure for the time then present, in
which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the
service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; which stood only in meats and drinks,
and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of  refor-
mation. But Christ being come an high priest of  good things to come, by a greater and
more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of  this building;
neither by the blood of  goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into
the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.… It was therefore neces-
sary that the patterns of  things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the
heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered
into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of  the true; but into heaven
itself, now to appear in the presence of  God for us.…

e.  Lev. 19:9–10,  19,  23,  27. And when ye reap the harvest of  your land, thou
shalt not wholly reap the corners of  thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings
of  thy harvest. And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every
grape of  thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD
your God.… Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a
diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment
mingled of  linen and woollen come upon thee.… And when ye shall come into the
land, and shall have planted all manner of  trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit
thereof  as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not
be eaten of.… Ye shall not round the corners of  your heads, neither shalt thou mar the

laws are now abrogated, under the new testament.f

4.  To them also, as a body politic, he gave sundry judicial laws,
which expired together with the State of  that people; not obliging

corners of  thy beard.  Deut. 24:19–21. When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy
field, and hast forgot a sheaf  in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be
for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless
thee in all the work of  thine hands. When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not
go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the
widow. When thou gatherest the grapes of  thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after-
ward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.  See 1 Cor. 5:7;
2 Cor. 6:17; Jude 23.

f.  Col. 2:14,  16–17. … blotting out the handwriting of  ordinances that was
against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of  the way, nailing it to his cross.…
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of  an holyday, or of
the new moon, or of  the sabbath days: which are a shadow of  things to come; but the
body is of  Christ.  Dan. 9:27. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one
week: and in the midst of  the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
cease, and for the overspreading of  abominations he shall make it desolate, even until
the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.  Eph.
2:15–16. … having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of  commandments
contained in ordinances; for to make in himself  of  twain one new man, so making
peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having
slain the enmity thereby.  Heb. 9:10. … which stood only in meats and drinks, and
divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of  reforma-
tion.  Acts 10:9–16. On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh
unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: and he
became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a
trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had
been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all
manner of  fourfooted beasts of  the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and
fowls of  the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter
said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. And
the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not
thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
Acts 11:2–10. And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of  the
circumcision contended with him, saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised,
and  didst  eat  with  them.  But  Peter  rehearsed  the  matter  from  the  beginning,  and
expounded it by order unto them, saying, I was in the city of  Joppa praying: and in a
trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down
from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: upon the which when I had
fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of  the earth, and wild
beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of  the air. And I heard a voice saying unto me,
Arise, Peter; slay and eat. But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean
hath at any time entered into my mouth. But the voice answered me again from heaven,
What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. And this was done three times:
and all were drawn up again into heaven.

any other now, further than the general equity thereof  may require.g
5.  The moral law doth forever bind all, as well justified persons as
others, to the obedience thereof;h and that, not only in regard of  the
matter contained in it, but also in respect of  the authority of  God the

g.  Ex. 21:1–23:19. Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before
them. If  thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he
shall go out free for nothing.… He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely
put to death.… And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to
death.… If  an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely
stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of  the ox shall be quit.… If  a
man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an
ox, and four sheep for a sheep.… And if  a man entice a maid that is not betrothed,
and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.… Thou shalt not suffer a
witch to live.… Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.… And ye shall be
holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of  beasts in the field; ye
shall cast it to the dogs. Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the
wicked to be an unrighteous witness.… Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in
the year.… The first of  the firstfruits of  thy land thou shalt bring into the house of  the
LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.  Cf. Gen. 49:10
with 1 Pet. 2:13–14.  1 Cor. 9:8–10. Say I these things as a man? or saith not the
law the same also? For it is written in the law of  Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the
mouth of  the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? Or saith he
it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth
should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of  his
hope.

h.  Rom. 13:8–10. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou
shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not
covet; and if  there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his
neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of  the law.  Rom. 3:31. Do we then make
void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.  Rom. 7:25. I thank
God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself  serve the law of
God; but with the flesh the law of  sin.  1 Cor. 9:21. [I became] to them that are
without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,)
that I might gain them that are without law.  Gal. 5:14. For all the law is fulfilled in
one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  Eph. 6:2–3. Honour
thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) that it may be
well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.  1 John 2:3–4,  7. And hereby
we do know that we know him, if  we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know
him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.…
Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which
ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard
from the beginning.  Cf. Rom. 3:20; Rom. 7:7–8 and 1 John 3:4 with Rom.

dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation.k

6.  Although true believers be not under the law, as a covenant of
works, to be thereby justified, or condemned;l yet is it of  great use to

i.  Deut. 6:4–5. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: and thou shalt
love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
might.  Ex. 20:11. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath
day, and hallowed it.  Rom. 3:19. Now we know that what things soever the law saith,
it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the
world may become guilty before God.  James 2:8,  10–11. If  ye fulfil the royal law
according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.… For
whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of  all. For
he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if  thou commit no
adultery, yet if  thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of  the law.  Matt. 19:4–6.
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at
the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.  Gen. 17:1. And when Abram was ninety years old
and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;
walk before me, and be thou perfect.

k.  Matt. 5:17–19. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whoso-
ever therefore shall break one of  these least commandments, and shall teach men so,
he shall be called the least in the kingdom of  heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Rom. 3:31. Do we
then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.  1 Cor.
9:21. [I became] to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law
to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
Luke 16:17–18. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of  the
law to fail. Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adul-
tery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adul-
tery.

l.  Rom. 6:14. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
law, but under grace.  Rom.7:4. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to
the law by the body of  Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who
is  raised  from  the  dead,  that  we  should  bring  forth  fruit  unto  God.    Gal.  2:16.
… knowing that a man is not justified by the works of  the law, but by the faith of  Jesus
Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
Christ, and not by the works of  the law: for by the works of  the law shall no flesh be
justified.  Gal. 3:13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of  the law, being made
a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.  Gal. 4:4–5.
But when the fulness of  the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of  a woman,
made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive

them, as well as to others; in that, as a rule of  life informing them of
the will of  God, and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk
accordingly;m discovering also the sinful pollutions of  their nature,
hearts, and lives;n so as, examining themselves thereby, they may come
to  further  conviction  of,  humiliation  for,  and  hatred  against  sin,o

the adoption of  sons.  Acts 13:38–39. Be it known unto you therefore, men and
brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of  sins: and by
him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by
the law of  Moses.  Rom. 8:1,  33. There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.… Who
shall lay any thing to the charge of  God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.

m.  Rom. 7:12,  22,  25. Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy,
and just, and good.… For I delight in the law of  God after the inward man.… I thank
God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself  serve the law of
God; but with the flesh the law of  sin.  Ps. 119:1–6. Blessed are the undefiled in the
way, who walk in the law of  the LORD. Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and
that seek him with the whole heart. They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.
Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. O that my ways were di-
rected to keep thy statutes! Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all
thy commandments.  1 Cor. 7:19. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is
nothing, but the keeping of  the commandments of  God.  Gal. 5:14–23. For all the
law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. But
if  ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of  another.
This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of  the flesh. For the
flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary
the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if  ye be led of
the Spirit, ye are not under the law. Now the works of  the flesh are manifest, which are
these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunken-
ness, revellings, and such like: of  the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in
time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of  God. But
the fruit of  the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meek-
ness, temperance: against such there is no law.

n.  Rom. 7:7,  13. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou
shalt not covet.… Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the
commandment might become exceeding sinful.  Rom. 3:20. Therefore by the deeds
of  the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of
sin.

o.  James 1:23–25. For if  any be a hearer of  the word, and not a doer, he is like
unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth
his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of  man he was. But whoso looketh
into the perfect law of  liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer,
but a doer of  the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.  Rom. 7:9,  14,  24. For
I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and

together with a clearer sight of  the need they have of  Christ, and the
perfection of  his obedience.p It is likewise of  use to the regenerate, to
restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin:q and the threatenings
of  it serve to show what even their sins deserve; and what afflictions,
in this life, they may expect for them, although freed from the curse
thereof  threatened in the law.r The promises of  it, in like manner,
show them God’s approbation of  obedience, and what blessings they
may expect upon the performance thereof:s although not as due to

I died.… For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.… O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of  this death?

p.  Gal. 3:24. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
that we might be justified by faith.  Rom. 7:24–25. O wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of  this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our
Lord. So then with the mind I myself  serve the law of  God; but with the flesh the law
of  sin.  Rom. 8:3–4. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of  sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of  the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

q.  James 2:11–12. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
kill. Now if  thou commit no adultery, yet if  thou kill, thou art become a transgressor
of  the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of  liberty.  Ps.
119:101,  104,  128. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep
thy word.… Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false
way.… Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate
every false way.

r.  Ezra 9:13–14. And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities
deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; should we again break thy com-
mandments, and join in affinity with the people of  these abominations? wouldest not
thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant
nor escaping?  Ps. 89:30–34. If  his children forsake my law, and walk not in my
judgments; if  they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I
visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my
lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My
covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of  my lips.  Gal. 3:13.
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of  the law, being made a curse for us: for it is
written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.

s.  Ex. 19:5–6. Now therefore, if  ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the
earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of  priests, and an holy nation. These
are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of  Israel.  Deut. 5:33. Ye shall
walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live,
and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which
ye shall possess.  Lev. 18:5. Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments:
which if  a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.  Matt. 19:17. And he said

them by the law as a covenant of  works.t So as, a man’s doing good,
and refraining from evil, because the law encourageth to the one,
and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of  his being under the
law; and, not under grace.u

unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if
thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.  Lev. 26:1–13. … If  ye walk in my
statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; then I will give you rain in due
season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of  the field shall yield their
fruit. And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto
the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you
afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of  the land, neither shall the sword go through your
land. And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.…
For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish
my covenant with you.… And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye
shall be my people.…  2 Cor. 6:16. And what agreement hath the temple of  God
with idols? for ye are the temple of  the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in
them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  Eph.
6:2–3. Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with prom-
ise;) that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.  Ps. 19:11.
Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of  them there is great re-
ward.  Ps. 37:11. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in
the abundance of  peace.  Matt. 5:5. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the
earth.

t.  Gal. 2:16. … knowing that a man is not justified by the works of  the law, but
by the faith of  Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be
justified by the faith of  Christ, and not by the works of  the law: for by the works of  the
law shall no flesh be justified.  Luke 17:10. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all
those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
done that which was our duty to do.

u.  Rom. 6:12–15. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of  unrigh-
teousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the
dead, and your members as instruments of  righteousness unto God. For sin shall not
have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then?
shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.  1 Pet.
3:8–12. Finally, be ye all of  one mind, having compassion one of  another, love as
brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a
blessing. For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from
evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek
peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of  the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their prayers: but the face of  the Lord is against them that do evil. And who
is he that will harm you, if  ye be followers of  that which is good?  With Ps. 34:12–
16. What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do

cheerfully, which the will of  God, revealed in the law, requireth to be

Chapter 20

Of  Christian Liberty

and Liberty of  Conscience

1.  The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under
the gospel consists in their freedom from the guilt of  sin, the con-
demning wrath of  God, the curse of  the moral law;a and, in their

good; seek peace, and pursue it. The eyes of  the LORD are upon the righteous, and his
ears are open unto their cry. The face of  the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut
off  the remembrance of  them from the earth.  Heb. 12:28–29. Wherefore we receiv-
ing a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God
acceptably with reverence and godly fear: for our God is a consuming fire.

w.  Rom. 3:31. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we
establish the law.  Gal. 3:21. Is the law then against the promises of  God? God for-
bid: for if  there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness
should have been by the law.  Titus 2:11–14. For the grace of  God that bringeth
salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for
that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of  the great God and our Saviour Jesus
Christ; who gave himself  for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
unto himself  a peculiar people, zealous of  good works.

x.  Ezek. 36:27. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.  Heb. 8:10. For this is the
covenant that I will make with the house of  Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I
will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them
a God, and they shall be to me a people.  With Jer. 31:33. But this shall be the
covenant that I will make with the house of  Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I
will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God,
and they shall be my people.  Ps. 119:35,  47. Make me to go in the path of  thy
commandments; for therein do I delight.…  And I will delight myself  in thy com-
mandments, which I have loved.  Rom. 7:22. For I delight in the law of  God after the
inward man.

a.  Titus 2:14. … who gave himself  for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto himself  a peculiar people, zealous of  good works.  1 Thess.
1:10. … and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even

being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and
dominion of  sin;b from the evil of  afflictions, the sting of  death, the
victory of  the grave, and everlasting damnation;c as also, in their free
access to God,d and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of
slavish fear, but a childlike love and willing mind.e All which were
common also to believers under the law.f But, under the new testa-

Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.  Gal. 3:13. Christ hath redeemed
us from the curse of  the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every
one that hangeth on a tree.

b.  Gal. 1:4. … who gave himself  for our sins, that he might deliver us from this
present evil world, according to the will of  God and our Father.  Col. 1:13. … who
hath delivered us from the power of  darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom
of  his dear Son.  Acts 26:18. [I send thee] to open their eyes, and to turn them from
darkness to light, and from the power of  Satan unto God, that they may receive for-
giveness of  sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in
me.  Rom. 6:14. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
law, but under grace.

c.  Rom. 8:28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that
love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  Ps. 119:71. It is good
for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.  2 Cor. 4:15–18. For
all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving
of  many redound to the glory of  God. For which cause we faint not; but though our
outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light afflic-
tion, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of  glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not
seen are eternal.  1 Cor. 15:54–57. So when this corruptible shall have put on incor-
ruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting?
O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of  death is sin; and the strength of  sin is the
law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Rom. 5:9. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from
wrath through him.  Rom. 8:1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  See 1
Thess. 1:10.

d.   Rom.  5:1–2. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace
wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of  the glory of  God.

e.  Rom. 8:14–15. For as many as are led by the Spirit of  God, they are the sons
of  God. For ye have not received the spirit of  bondage again to fear; but ye have
received the Spirit of  adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  Gal. 4:6. And be-
cause ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of  his Son into your hearts, crying,
Abba, Father.  1 John 4:18. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

f.  Gal. 3:8–9,  14. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the hea-
then through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all

ment, the liberty of  Christians is further enlarged, in their freedom
from the yoke of  the ceremonial law, to which the Jewish church was
subjected;g and in greater boldness of  access to the throne of  grace,h

nations  be  blessed.  So  then  they  which  be  of   faith  are  blessed  with  faithful  Abra-
ham.… that the blessing of  Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ;
that we might receive the promise of  the Spirit through faith.  Rom. 4:6–8. Even as
David also describeth the blessedness of  the man, unto whom God imputeth righ-
teousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  1
Cor. 10:3–4. And [our fathers] did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink
the same spiritual drink: for they drank of  that spiritual Rock that followed them: and
that Rock was Christ.  Heb. 11:1–40. Now faith is the substance of  things hoped for,
the evidence of  things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.… By faith
Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained
witness that he was righteous, God testifying of  his gifts: and by it he being dead yet
speaketh.… By faith Noah, being warned of  God of  things not seen as yet, moved
with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of  his house; by the which he condemned the
world, and became heir of  the righteousness which is by faith. By faith Abraham,
when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inherit-
ance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.… By faith Moses, when
he was come to years, refused to be called the son of  Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing
rather to suffer affliction with the people of  God, than to enjoy the pleasures of  sin for
a season; esteeming the reproach of  Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt:
for he had respect unto the recompence of  the reward.… And these all, having ob-
tained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided
some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

g.  Gal. 4:1–7. Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing
from a servant, though he be lord of  all; but is under tutors and governors until the
time appointed of  the father. Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage
under the elements of  the world: but when the fulness of  the time was come, God sent
forth his Son, made of  a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
under the law, that we might receive the adoption of  sons. And because ye are sons,
God hath sent forth the Spirit of  his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Where-
fore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if  a son, then an heir of  God through
Christ.  Gal. 5:1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of  bondage.  Acts 15:10–11. Now
therefore  why  tempt  ye  God,  to  put  a  yoke  upon  the  neck  of   the  disciples,  which
neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of
the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.

h.  Heb. 4:14–16. Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into
the heavens, Jesus the Son of  God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an
high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of  our infirmities; but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the
throne of  grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of  need.
Heb. 10:19–22. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
blood of  Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the

and in fuller communications of  the free Spirit of  God, than believ-
ers under the law did ordinarily partake of.i

2.  God alone is Lord of  the conscience,k and hath left it free from
the doctrines and commandments of  men, which are, in anything,
contrary to his Word; or beside it, if  matters of  faith, or worship.l So

veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over the house of  God; let us
draw near with a true heart in full assurance of  faith, having our hearts sprinkled from
an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

i.  John 7:38–39. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of  his
belly shall flow rivers of  living water. (But this spake he of  the Spirit, which they that
believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus
was not yet glorified.)  Acts 2:17–18. And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith
God, I will pour out of  my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
dreams: and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of
my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.  2 Cor. 3:8,  13,  17–18. How shall not the minis-
tration of  the spirit be rather glorious?… And not as Moses, which put a vail over his
face, that the children of  Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of  that which is
abolished.… Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of  the Lord is, there is
liberty. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of  the Lord, are
changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of  the Lord.
See Jer. 31:31–34.

k.  James 4:12. There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art
thou that judgest another?  Rom. 14:4,  10. Who art thou that judgest another man’s
servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God
is able to make him stand.… But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou
set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of  Christ.
1 Cor. 10:29. Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of  the other: for why is my liberty
judged of  another man’s conscience?

l.  Acts 4:19. But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
right in the sight of  God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  Acts
5:29. Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God
rather than men.  1 Cor. 7:22–23. For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant,
is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.
Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of  men.  Matt. 15:1–6. Then came
to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of  Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples
transgress  the  tradition  of   the  elders?  for  they  wash  not  their  hands  when  they
eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the com-
mandment of  God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honour thy fa-
ther and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye
say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou
mightest  be  profited  by  me;  and  honour  not  his  father  or  his  mother,  he  shall  be
free. Thus have ye made the commandment of  God of  none effect by your tradition.
Matt. 23:8–10. But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and
all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,
which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.

that, to believe such doctrines, or to obey such commands, out of
conscience, is to betray true liberty of  conscience:m and the requiring
of  an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to de-
stroy liberty of  conscience, and reason also.n

3.  They who, upon pretense of  Christian liberty, do practice any
sin, or cherish any lust, do thereby destroy the end of  Christian lib-
erty, which is, that being delivered out of  the hands of  our enemies,
we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness
before him, all the days of  our life.o

2 Cor. 1:24. Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of  your
joy: for by faith ye stand.  Matt. 15:9. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men.

m.  Col. 2:20–23. Wherefore if  ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of
the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, (touch not;
taste not; handle not; which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments
and doctrines of  men? Which things have indeed a shew of  wisdom in will worship,
and humility, and neglecting of  the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of  the
flesh.  Gal. 1:10. For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for
if  I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of  Christ.  Gal. 2:4–5. … and that
because of  false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our
liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: to whom
we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of  the gospel might
continue with you.  Gal. 4:9–10. But now, after that ye have known God, or rather
are known of  God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto
ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
Gal. 5:1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and
be not entangled again with the yoke of  bondage.

n.  Rom. 10:17. So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
God.  Isa. 8:20. To the law and to the testimony: if  they speak not according to this
word, it is because there is no light in them.  Acts 17:11. These were more noble than
those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of  mind, and
searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.  John 4:22. Ye worship ye
know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of  the Jews.  Rev. 13:12,
16–17. And he exerciseth all the power of  the first beast before him, and causeth the
earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound
was healed.… And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,
to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy
or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of  the beast, or the number of  his
name.  Jer. 8:9. The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they
have rejected the word of  the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?  1 Pet. 3:15. But
sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every
man that asketh you a reason of  the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.

o.  Gal. 5:13. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty
for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.  1 Pet. 2:16. … as free,
and not using your liberty for a cloke of  maliciousness, but as the servants of  God.

4.  And because the powers which God hath ordained, and the
liberty  which  Christ  hath  purchased,  are  not  intended  by  God  to
destroy, but mutually to uphold and preserve one another, they who,
upon pretense of  Christian liberty, shall oppose any lawful power, or
the lawful exercise of  it, whether it be civil or ecclesiastical, resist the
ordinance of  God.p And, for their publishing of  such opinions, or
maintaining of  such practices, as are contrary to the light of  nature,
or to the known principles of  Christianity (whether concerning faith,
worship, or conversation), or to the power of  godliness; or, such erro-
neous opinions or practices, as either in their own nature, or in the
manner of  publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the
external peace and order which Christ hath established in the church,
they may lawfully be called to account, and proceeded against, by

2 Pet. 2:19. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of  whom a man is overcome, of  the same is he brought in bondage.
Rom. 6:15. What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under
grace? God forbid.  John 8:34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of  sin.  Luke 1:74–75. … that he would
grant unto us, that we being delivered out of  the hand of  our enemies might serve him
without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of  our life.

p.  1 Pet. 2:13–14,  16. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of  man for the
Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them
that are sent by him for the punishment of  evildoers, and for the praise of  them that
do well.… as free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of  maliciousness, but as the
servants of  God.  Rom. 13:1–8. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but of  God: the powers that be are ordained of  God. Whosoever
therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of  God: and they that resist shall
receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the
evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of  the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt
have praise of  the same: for he is the minister of  God to thee for good. But if  thou do
that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister
of  God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must
needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For for this cause pay
ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom
custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. Owe no man any thing, but to
love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.  Heb. 13:17. Obey
them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls,
as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that
is unprofitable for you.  1 Thess. 5:12–13. And we beseech you, brethren, to know
them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among
yourselves.

the censures of  the church.q

q.  Rom. 1:32. … who knowing the judgment of  God, that they which commit
such things are worthy of  death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that
do them.  1 Cor. 5:1,  5,  11–13. It is reported commonly that there is fornication
among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that
one should have his father’s wife.… to deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruc-
tion of  the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of  the Lord Jesus.… But now
I have written unto you not to keep company, if  any man that is called a brother be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner;
with such an one no not to eat. For what have I to do to judge them also that are
without? do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God judgeth.
Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.  2 John 10–11. If
there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house,
neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of  his evil
deeds.  2 Thess. 3:6,  14. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of  our Lord
Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly,
and not after the tradition which he received of  us.… And if  any man obey not our
word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be
ashamed.  1 Tim. 6:3–4. If  any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
words, even the words of  our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according
to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of
words, whereof  cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings.  Titus 1:10–11,  13–14.
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of  the circum-
cision: whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things
which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.… This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke
them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; not giving heed to Jewish fables, and
commandments of  men, that turn from the truth.  Titus 3:10. A man that is an
heretick after the first and second admonition reject.  Rom. 16:17. Now I beseech
you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine
which ye have learned; and avoid them.  Matt. 18:15–17. Moreover if  thy brother
shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if  he
shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if  he will not hear thee, then take
with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of  two or three witnesses every word
may be established. And if  he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if
he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
1 Tim. 1:19–20. … holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
away concerning faith have made shipwreck: of  whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander;
whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.  Rev. 2:2,
14–15,  20. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst
not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles,
and are not, and hast found them liars.… But I have a few things against thee, because
thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of  Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of  Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to
commit fornication. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of  the Nicolaitanes,
which thing I hate.… Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself  a prophetess, to teach and to se-
duce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

Of  Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day

Chapter 21

1.  The light of  nature showeth that there is a God, who hath
lordship and sovereignty over all, is good, and doth good unto all,
and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in,
and  served,  with  all  the  heart,  and  with  all  the  soul,  and  with  all
the might.a But the acceptable way of  worshiping the true God is
a.  Rom. 1:20. For the invisible things of  him from the creation of  the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
Godhead; so that they are without excuse.  Ps. 19:1–4a. The heavens declare the
glory of  God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech,
and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where
their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
the end of  the world.  Ps. 50:6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for
God is judge himself. Selah.  Ps. 97:6. The heavens declare his righteousness, and all
the people see his glory.  Ps.  145:9–12. The  LORD is good to all: and his tender
mercies are over all his works. All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints
shall bless thee. They shall speak of  the glory of  thy kingdom, and talk of  thy power;
to make known to the sons of  men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of  his
kingdom.  Acts 14:17. Nevertheless he left not himself  without witness, in that he did
good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food
and gladness.  Ps. 104:1–35. Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art
very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.… Who laid the foundations of
the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.… He causeth the grass to grow for
the cattle, and herb for the service of  man: that he may bring forth food out of  the
earth.… O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all:
the earth is full of  thy riches.… The glory of  the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD
shall rejoice in his works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
hills, and they smoke. I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my
God while I have my being. My meditation of  him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
LORD.…  Ps. 86:8–10. Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
are there any works like unto thy works. All nations whom thou hast made shall come
and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. For thou art great, and
doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.  Ps. 95:1–6. O come, let us sing unto the
LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of  our salvation. Let us come before his
presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. For the
LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. In his hand are the deep places
of  the earth: the strength of  the hills is his also. The sea is his, and he made it: and his
hands formed the dry land. O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before
the LORD our maker.  Ps. 89:5–7. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD:
thy faithfulness also in the congregation of  the saints. For who in the heaven can be
compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of  the mighty can be likened unto the
LORD? God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of  the saints, and to be had in
reverence of  all them that are about him.  Deut. 6:4–5. Hear, O Israel: The LORD

instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will, that he
may not be worshiped according to the imaginations and devices of
men, or the suggestions of  Satan, under any visible representation,
or any other way not prescribed in the Holy Scripture.b

our God is one LORD: and thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

b.  Deut. 12:32. What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
not add thereto, nor diminish from it.  Matt. 15:9. But in vain they do worship me,
teaching for doctrines the commandments of  men.  Acts 17:23–25. For as I passed
by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UN-
KNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. God
that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of  heaven and earth,
dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as
though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.
Matt. 4:9–10. And [the devil] saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if  thou
wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for
it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Deut. 4:15–20. Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
of  similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of  the midst of  the
fire: lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of  any
figure, the likeness of  male or female, the likeness of  any beast that is on the earth, the
likeness of  any winged fowl that flieth in the air, the likeness of  any thing that creepeth
on the ground, the likeness of  any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: and lest
thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and
the stars, even all the host of  heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve
them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of  the iron furnace, even out
of  Egypt, to be unto him a people of  inheritance, as ye are this day.  Ex. 20:4–6.
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of  any thing that is
in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
thou shalt not bow down thyself  to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am
a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of  the fathers upon the children unto the third and
fourth generation of  them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of  them
that love me, and keep my commandments.  John 4:23–24. But the hour cometh,
and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth:
for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him
must worship him in spirit and in truth.  Col. 2:18–23. Let no man beguile you of
your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of  angels, intruding into those
things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding
the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment minis-
tered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of  God. Wherefore if  ye be dead
with Christ from the rudiments of  the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye
subject to ordinances, (touch not; taste not; handle not; which all are to perish with the
using;) after the commandments and doctrines of  men? Which things have indeed a
shew of  wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of  the body; not in any
honour to the satisfying of  the flesh.

2.  Religious worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost; and to him alone;c not to angels, saints, or any other
creature:d and, since the fall, not without a Mediator; nor in the me-
diation of  any other but of  Christ alone.e

3.  Prayer, with thanksgiving, being one special part of  religious
worship,f  is  by  God  required  of   all  men:g  and,  that  it  may  be

c.  John 5:23. … that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.  2 Cor. 13:14. The grace of  the
Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of  God, and the communion of  the Holy Ghost, be
with you all. Amen.  Eph. 3:14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of  our
Lord Jesus Christ.  Rev. 5:11–14. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of  many angels
round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of  them was
ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of  thousands; saying with a loud
voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom,
and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.  And every creature which is in
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that
are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him
that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. And the four beasts
said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth
for ever and ever.  Acts 10:25–26. And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him,
and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand
up; I myself  also am a man.

d.  Col. 2:18. Let no man beguile you of  your reward in a voluntary humility and
worshipping  of   angels,  intruding  into  those  things  which  he  hath  not  seen,  vainly
puffed up by his fleshly mind.  Rev. 19:10. And I fell at his feet to worship him. And
he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of  thy brethren that
have the testimony of  Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of  Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy.  Rom. 1:25. … who changed the truth of  God into a lie, and worshipped
and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

e.  John 14:6. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father, but by me.  1  Tim.  2:5. For there is one God, and one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.  Eph. 2:18. For through him
we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.  Col. 3:17. And whatsoever ye do
in word or deed, do all in the name of  the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the
Father by him.

f.  Phil. 4:6. Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.  1 Tim. 2:1. I exhort
therefore, that, first of  all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of  thanks,
be made for all men.   Col.  4:2. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with
thanksgiving.

g.  Ps. 65:2. O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.  Ps. 67:3.
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.  Ps. 96:7–8. Give

tongue.m

Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his
courts.  Ps. 148:11–13. Kings of  the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the
name of  the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and
heaven.  Isa. 55:6–7. Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him
while he is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon.

h.  John 14:13–14. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that
the Father may be glorified in the Son. If  ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do
it.  1 Pet. 2:5. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priest-
hood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

i.  Rom. 8:26. Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself  maketh intercession for us
with groanings which cannot be uttered.  Eph. 6:18. … praying always with all prayer
and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and sup-
plication for all saints.

k.  1 John 5:14. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if  we ask any

thing according to his will, he heareth us.

l.  Ps. 47:7. For God is the King of  all the earth: sing ye praises with understand-
ing.  Eccl. 5:1–2. Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of  God, and be more
ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of  fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before
God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.  Heb.
12:28. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace,
whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.  Gen. 18:27.
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.  James 5:16. Confess your faults one to
another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer
of  a righteous man availeth much.  James 1:6–7. But let him ask in faith, nothing
wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of  the sea driven with the wind and
tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of  the Lord.  Mark
11:24. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe
that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.  Matt. 6:12,  14–15. And forgive us our
debts, as we forgive our debtors.… For if  ye forgive men their trespasses, your heav-
enly Father will also forgive you: but if  ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
your Father forgive your trespasses.  Col. 4:2. Continue in prayer, and watch in the
same with thanksgiving.  Eph. 6:18. … praying always with all prayer and supplica-
tion in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for

which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not
unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.  John 15:7.
If  ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be
done unto you.

o.    1  Tim.  2:1–2.  I  exhort  therefore,  that,  first  of   all,  supplications,  prayers,
intercessions, and giving of  thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are
in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
John 17:20. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on
me through their word.  2 Sam. 7:29. Therefore now let it please thee to bless the
house of  thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD,
hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of  thy servant be blessed for ever.
2 Chron. 6:14–42. And said, O LORD God of  Israel, there is no God like thee in the
heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy ser-
vants, that walk before thee with all their hearts.… Now therefore, O LORD God of
Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him,
saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of  Israel; yet
so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked
before  me.…  Hearken  therefore  unto  the  supplications  of   thy  servant,  and  of   thy
people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling
place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.… Moreover concerning the
stranger, which is not of  thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great
name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if  they come and pray
in this house; then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do
according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of  the earth may
know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house
which I have built is called by thy name.…

p.  Luke 16:25–26. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted,
and thou art tormented. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to
us, that would come from thence.  Isa. 57:1–2. The righteous perisheth, and no man
layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righ-
teous is taken away from the evil to come. He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in
their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.  Ps. 73:24. Thou shalt guide me with
thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.  2 Cor. 5:8,  10. We are confident, I
say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.…
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of  Christ; that every one may receive
the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
Phil. 1:21–24. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But if  I live in the flesh,
this is the fruit of  my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. For I am in a strait
betwixt  two,  having  a  desire  to  depart,  and  to  be  with  Christ;  which  is  far  better:
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.  Rev. 14:13. And I heard a

receiving of  the sacraments instituted by Christ, are all parts of  the

voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord

q.  1 John 5:16. If  any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto
death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.

r.  Luke 4:16–17. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up:
and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up
for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of  the prophet Esaias. And
when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written …  Acts
15:21. For Moses of  old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in
the synagogues every sabbath day.  Col. 4:16. And when this epistle is read among
you, cause that it be read also in the church of  the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise
read the epistle from Laodicea.  1 Thess. 5:27. I charge you by the Lord that this
epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.  Rev. 1:3. Blessed is he that readeth, and
they that hear the words of  this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
therein: for the time is at hand.

s.  2 Tim. 4:2. Preach the word; be instant in season, out of  season; reprove,
rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.  Acts 5:42. And daily in the temple,
and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

t.  James 1:22. But be ye doers of  the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
own selves.  Acts 10:33. Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all
things that are commanded thee of  God.  Matt. 13:19. When any one heareth the
word of  the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and
catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the
way side.  Heb. 4:2. For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard
it.  Isa. 66:2. For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have

contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.

u.  Col. 3:16. Let the word of  Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
grace in your hearts to the Lord.  Eph. 5:19. Speaking to yourselves in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.
James 5:13. Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing
psalms.  1 Cor. 14:15. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with
the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understand-
ing also.

w.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.  1 Cor. 11:23–29. For I
have received of  the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus
the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks,
he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
remembrance of  me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in
remembrance of  me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew
the Lord’s death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this
cup of  the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of  the body and blood of  the Lord. But let
a man examine himself, and so let him eat of  that bread, and drink of  that cup. For he
that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
discerning the Lord’s body.  Acts 2:42. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’
doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of  bread, and in prayers.

x.  Deut. 6:13. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
swear  by  his  name.    Neh.  10:29.  They  clave  to  their  brethren,  their  nobles,  and
entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses
the servant of  God, and to observe and do all the commandments of  the LORD our
Lord, and his judgments and his statutes.  2 Cor. 1:23. Moreover I call God for a
record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.

y.  Ps. 116:14. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of  all his
people.  Isa. 19:21. And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a
vow unto the LORD, and perform it.  Eccl. 5:4–5. When thou vowest a vow unto
God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast
vowed. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not
pay.

z.  Joel 2:12. Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your
heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.  Est. 4:16. Go, gather
together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat
nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will
I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if  I perish, I perish.  Matt.
9:15. And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of  the bridechamber mourn, as
long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom
shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.  Acts 14:23. And when they had
ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended
them to the Lord, on whom they believed.

a.  Ex. 15:1–21. Then sang Moses and the children of  Israel this song unto the
LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously:
the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The LORD is my strength and song,
and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
my father’s God, and I will exalt him. The LORD is a man of  war: the LORD is his
name. Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains
also are drowned in the Red sea.… And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of  Aaron,
took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and

are, in their several times and seasons, to be used in an holy and
religious manner.b

6.  Neither prayer, nor any other part of  religious worship, is now,
under the gospel, either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any
place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed:c but
God is to be worshiped everywhere,d in spirit and truth;e as, in pri-
vate familiesf daily,g and in secret, each one by himself;h so, more
with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed
gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.  Ps. 107:1–43. O give
thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Let the re-
deemed of  the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of  the enemy;
and gathered them out of  the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north,
and from the south.… Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he deliv-
ered them out of  their distresses.… Oh that men would praise the LORD for his good-
ness, and for his wonderful works to the children of  men.…  Neh. 12:27–43. And at
the dedication of  the wall of  Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of  all their places,
to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgiv-
ings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. And the sons of  the
singers gathered themselves together, both out of  the plain country round about Jerusa-
lem, and from the villages of  Netophathi.… So stood the two companies of  them that
gave thanks in the house of  God, and I, and the half  of  the rulers with me.… Also that
day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with
great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of  Jerusalem was
heard even afar off.  Est. 9:20–22. And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters
unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of  the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and
far, to stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of  the month
Adar, and the fifteenth day of  the same, yearly, as the days wherein the Jews rested
from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy,
and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of  feasting and
joy, and of  sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.

b.  Heb. 12:28. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let
us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.
c.  John 4:21. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when

ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

d.  Mal. 1:11. For from the rising of  the sun even unto the going down of  the
same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be
offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the
heathen, saith the LORD of  hosts.  1 Tim. 2:8. I will therefore that men pray every
where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

e.  John 4:23–24. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship
him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in
truth.

f.  Jer. 10:25. Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon
the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured
him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.  Deut. 6:6–7. And

fully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God, by his Word or provi-

these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt
teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of  them when thou sittest in
thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
thou risest up.  Job 1:5. And it was so, when the days of  their feasting were gone
about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered
burnt offerings according to the number of  them all: for Job said, It may be that my
sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.  2 Sam.
6:18,  20. And as soon as David had made an end of  offering burnt offerings and
peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of  the LORD of  hosts.…  Then
David returned to bless his household.…

g.  Matt. 6:11. Give us this day our daily bread.  See Job 1:5.
h.  Matt. 6:6,  16–18. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.… Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypo-
crites, of  a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto
men  to  fast.  Verily  I  say  unto  you,  They  have  their  reward.  But  thou,  when  thou
fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to fast,
but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
reward thee openly.  Neh. 1:4–11. And it came to pass, when I heard these words,
that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before
the God of  heaven, and said, … O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive
to the prayer of  thy servant, and to the prayer of  thy servants, who desire to fear thy
name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight
of  this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.  Dan. 9:3–4a.  And I set my face unto the
Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplication, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
and I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession.…

i.  Isa. 56:6–7. Also the sons of  the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to
serve him, and to love the name of  the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth
the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of  my covenant; even them will I bring
to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of  prayer: their burnt offer-
ings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be
called an house of  prayer for all people.  Heb. 10:25. Not forsaking the assembling
of  ourselves together, as the manner of  some is; but exhorting one another: and so
much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  Ps. 100:4. Enter into his gates with
thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
Ps. 122:1. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of  the LORD.
Ps. 84:1–12. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of  hosts! My soul longeth,
yea, even fainteth for the courts of  the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the
living God.… For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
doorkeeper in the house of  my God, than to dwell in the tents of  wickedness.… O
LORD of  hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.  Luke 4:16. And he came to
Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the
synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.  Acts 13:42,  44. And when
the  Jews  were  gone  out  of   the  synagogue,  the  Gentiles  besought  that  these  words

7.  As it is the law of  nature, that, in general, a due proportion of
time be set apart for the worship of  God; so, in his Word, by a posi-
tive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages,
he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be
kept holy unto him:k which, from the beginning of  the world to the
resurrection of  Christ, was the last day of  the week; and, from the
resurrection of  Christ, was changed into the first day of  the week,l
which, in Scripture, is called the Lord’s Day,m and is to be continued
to the end of  the world, as the Christian Sabbath.n

might be preached to them the next sabbath.… And the next sabbath day came al-
most the whole city together to hear the word of  God.  Acts 2:42. And they contin-
ued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of  bread, and
in prayers.

k.  Ex. 20:8–11. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of  the LORD thy God: in
it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor
thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days
the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the sev-
enth day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  Isa. 56:2–7.
Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of  man that layeth hold on it; that
keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. Nei-
ther let the son of  the stranger, that hath joined himself  to the LORD, speak, saying,
The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Be-
hold, I am a dry tree. For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths,
and choose the things that please me, and take hold of  my covenant; even unto them
will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of  sons
and of  daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. Also
the sons of  the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the
name of  the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from pollut-
ing it, and taketh hold of  my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain,
and make them joyful in my house of  prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices
shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of  prayer
for all people.

l.  Gen. 2:2–3. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God
blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his
work which God created and made.  1 Cor. 16:1–2. Now concerning the collection
for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of  Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the
first day of  the week let every one of  you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered
him, that there be no gatherings when I come.  Acts 20:7. And upon the first day of
the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them,
ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

m.  Rev. 1:10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great

voice, as of  a trumpet.

n.  Matt. 5:17–18. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:

8.  This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after
a due preparing of  their hearts, and ordering of  their common af-
fairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest, all the day, from
their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employ-
ments and recreations,o but also are taken up, the whole time, in the

I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  Mark
2:27–28. And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for
the sabbath: therefore the Son of  man is Lord also of  the sabbath.  Rom. 13:8–10.
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath ful-
filled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt
not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if  there be any
other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
fulfilling of  the law.  James 2:8–12. If  ye fulfil the royal law according to the scrip-
ture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: but if  ye have respect to
persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of  the law as transgressors. For whosoever
shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of  all. For he that
said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if  thou commit no adultery,
yet if  thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of  the law. So speak ye, and so do, as
they that shall be judged by the law of  liberty.

o.  Ex. 20:8. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  Ex. 16:23–30. And he
said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of  the
holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye
will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was
there any worm therein. And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the
seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. And it came to pass, that
there went out some of  the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found
none. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments
and my laws? See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth
you on the sixth day the bread of  two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man
go out of  his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day.  Ex.
31:15–17. Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of  rest, holy
to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to
death. Wherefore the children of  Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath
throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the
children of  Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the
seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.  Isa. 58:13–14. If  thou turn away thy foot
from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a
delight, the holy of  the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own
ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou
delight thyself  in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of  the
earth, and feed thee with the heritage of  Jacob thy father: for the mouth of  the LORD
hath spoken it.  Neh. 13:15–22. In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine

presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes,
and figs, and all manner of  burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sab-
bath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There
dwelt men of  Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of  ware, and sold
on the sabbath unto the children of  Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with
the nobles of  Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane
the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil
upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the
sabbath. And  it  came  to  pass,  that  when  the  gates  of   Jerusalem  began  to  be  dark
before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they
should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of  my servants set I at the gates,
that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So the merchants and
sellers of  all kind of  ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified
against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if  ye do so again, I
will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I
commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should
come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God,
concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of  thy mercy.

p.  Isa. 58:13–14. If  thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
pleasure  on  my  holy  day;  and  call  the  sabbath  a  delight,  the  holy  of   the  LORD,
honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself  in the LORD;
and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the
heritage of  Jacob thy father: for the mouth of  the LORD hath spoken it.  Luke 4:16.
And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he
went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.  Matt. 12:1–
13. At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples
were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of  corn, and to eat. But when the
Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to
do upon the sabbath day. But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did,
when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; how he entered into the house
of  God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
them which were with him, but only for the priests? Or have ye not read in the law,
how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
blameless? But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple. But if
ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not
have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of  man is Lord even of  the sabbath day.
And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: and, behold, there
was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to
heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. And he said unto them, What
man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if  it fall into a pit on the
sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better
than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. Then saith he to
the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole,
like as the other.  Mark 3:1–5. And he entered again into the synagogue; and there

Of  Lawful Oaths and Vows

1.  A lawful oath is a part of  religious worship,a wherein, upon
just occasion, the person swearing solemnly calleth God to witness
what he asserteth, or promiseth, and to judge him according to the
truth or falsehood of  what he sweareth.b

2.  The name of  God only is that by which men ought to swear,
and therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence.c There-
fore, to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name;

was a man there which had a withered hand. And they watched him, whether he
would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. And he saith unto the
man which had the withered hand, Stand forth. And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to
do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their
peace. And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for
the hardness of  their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.

a.  Deut. 10:20. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.  Isa. 45:23. I have sworn by myself, the
word is gone out of  my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me
every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.  Rom. 14:11. For it is written, As I
live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
Phil. 2:10–11. That at the name of  Jesus every knee should bow, of  things in heaven,
and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of  God the Father.

b.  Ex. 20:7. Thou shalt not take the name of  the LORD thy God in vain; for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  Lev. 19:12. And ye
shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of  thy God: I
am the LORD.  Rom. 1:9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
gospel of  his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of  you always in my prayers.
2 Cor. 1:23. Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came
not as yet unto Corinth.  2 Cor. 11:31. The God and Father of  our Lord Jesus Christ,
which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.  Gal. 1:20. Now the things
which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.  2 Chron. 6:22–23. If  a man
sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the
oath come before thine altar in this house; then hear thou from heaven, and do, and
judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own
head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.

c.  Deut. 6:13. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
swear by his name.  Josh. 23:7. … that ye come not among these nations, these that
remain among you; neither make mention of  the name of  their gods, nor cause to
swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.

or, to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred.d
Yet, as in matters of  weight and moment, an oath is warranted by the
Word of  God, under the new testament as well as under the old;e so
a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful authority, in such matters,
ought to be taken.f

3.  Whosoever taketh an oath ought duly to consider the weighti-
ness of  so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he
is fully persuaded is the truth:g neither may any man bind himself  by
oath to anything but what is good and just, and what he believeth so
to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform.h

d.  Ex. 20:7. Thou shalt not take the name of  the LORD thy God in vain; for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  Jer. 5:7. How shall I
pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no
gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled
themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.  Matt. 5:33–37. Again, ye have heard
that it hath been said by them of  old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt
perform unto the Lord thine oaths: but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by
heaven; for it is God’s throne: nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusa-
lem; for it is the city of  the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because
thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea,
yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of  evil.  James 5:12. But
above  all  things,  my  brethren,  swear  not,  neither  by  heaven,  neither  by  the  earth,
neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into
condemnation.

e.  Heb. 6:16. For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation
is to them an end of  all strife.  2 Cor. 1:23. Moreover I call God for a record upon my
soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.  Isa. 65:16. … that he who
blesseth himself  in the earth shall bless himself  in the God of  truth; and he that sweareth
in the earth shall swear by the God of  truth; because the former troubles are forgotten,
and because they are hid from mine eyes.

f.  1 Kings 8:31. If  any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house …
Neh. 13:25. And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of
them, and plucked off  their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not
give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for
yourselves.  Ezra 10:5. Then arose Ezra, and made the chief  priests, the Levites, and
all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.

g.  Ex. 20:7. Thou shalt not take the name of  the LORD thy God in vain; for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  Lev. 19:12. And ye
shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of  thy God: I
am the LORD.  Jer. 4:2. And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment,
and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall
they glory.  Hos. 10:4. They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a cov-
enant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of  the field.

h.  Gen. 24:2–9. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of  his house, that

4.  An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of  the
words, without equivocation, or mental reservation.i It cannot oblige
to sin; but in anything not sinful, being taken, it binds to performance,
although to a man’s own hurt.k Nor is it to be violated, although made
to heretics, or infidels.l

ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make
thee swear by the LORD, the God of  heaven, and the God of  the earth, that thou shalt
not  take  a  wife  unto  my  son  of   the  daughters  of   the  Canaanites,  among  whom  I
dwell.… And the servant put his hand under the thigh of  Abraham his master, and
sware to him concerning that matter.  Neh. 5:12–13. Then said they, We will restore
them, and will require nothing of  them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
priests, and took an oath of  them, that they should do according to this promise. Also
I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his
labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.
And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did ac-
cording to this promise.  Eccl. 5:2,  5. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine
heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon
earth: therefore let thy words be few.… Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than
that thou shouldest vow and not pay.

i.  Jer. 4:2. And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in
righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they
glory.  Ps. 24:4. He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

k.  1 Sam. 25:22,  32–34. So and more also do God unto the enemies of  David,
if  I leave of  all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the
wall.… And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of  Israel, which sent thee
this day to meet me: and blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept
me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself  with mine own
hand. For in very deed, as the LORD God of  Israel liveth, which hath kept me back
from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had
not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.  Ps.
15:4. … He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.

l.  Ezek. 17:16–19. As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the
king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he
brake, even with him in the midst of  Babylon he shall die. Neither shall Pharaoh with
his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts,
and building forts, to cut off  many persons: seeing he despised the oath by breaking
the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall
not escape. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath
despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his
own head.  Josh. 9:18–19. And the children of  Israel smote them not, because the
princes of  the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of  Israel. And all
the congregation murmured against the princes. But all the princes said unto all the
congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of  Israel: now therefore we
may not touch them.  2 Sam. 21:1. Then there was a famine in the days of  David

5.  A vow is of  the like nature with a promissory oath, and ought
to be made with the like religious care, and to be performed with the
like faithfulness.m

6.  It is not to be made to any creature, but to God alone:n and,
that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of  faith, and
conscience of  duty, in way of  thankfulness for mercy received, or for
the obtaining of  what we want, whereby we more strictly bind our-
selves to necessary duties; or, to other things, so far and so long as
they may fitly conduce thereunto.o

three years, year after year; and David inquired of  the LORD. And the LORD answered,
It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.

m.  Num. 30:2. If  a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth
out  of   his  mouth.   Isa.  19:21.  And  the  LORD  shall  be  known  to  Egypt,  and  the
Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea,
they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.  Eccl. 5:4–6. When thou vowest
a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which
thou hast vowed. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow
and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the
angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy
the work of  thine hands?  Ps. 61:8. So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that
I may daily perform my vows.  Ps. 66:13–14. I will go into thy house with burnt
offerings: I will pay thee my vows, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath
spoken, when I was in trouble.

n.  Ps. 50:14. Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
High.  Ps. 76:11. Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about
him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.  Ps. 116:14. I will pay my vows
unto the LORD now in the presence of  all his people.

o.  Deut. 23:21–23. When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou
shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of  thee; and it
would be sin in thee. But if  thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. That
which is gone out of  thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering,
according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with
thy mouth.  Gen. 28:20–22. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If  God will be with me,
and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to
put on, so that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my
God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of  all that
thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.  1 Sam. 1:11. And she vowed
a vow, and said, O LORD of  hosts, if  thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of  thine
handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine
handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of  his life, and
there shall no rasor come upon his head.  Ps. 66:13–14. I will go into thy house with
burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth
hath spoken, when I was in trouble.  Ps. 132:2–5. … how he sware unto the LORD,

7.  No man may vow to do anything forbidden in the Word of
God, or what would hinder any duty therein commanded, or which
is not in his own power, and for the performance whereof  he hath no
promise of  ability from God.p In which respects, popish monastical
vows of  perpetual single life, professed poverty, and regular obedi-
ence, are so far from being degrees of  higher perfection, that they are
superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian may entangle
himself.q

and vowed unto the mighty God of  Jacob; surely I will not come into the tabernacle of
my house, nor go up into my bed; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
eyelids, until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of
Jacob.

p.  Acts 23:12–14. And when it was day, certain of  the Jews banded together,
and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till
they had killed Paul. And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
And they came to the chief  priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves
under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.  Mark 6:26.
And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat
with him, he would not reject her.  Num. 30:5,  8,  12–13. But if  her father disallow
her in the day that he heareth; not any of  her vows, or of  her bonds wherewith she
hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father
disallowed her.… But if  her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then
he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips,
wherewith she bound her soul, of  none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.… But if
her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever
proceeded out of  her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of  her soul,
shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or
her husband may make it void.

q.  Matt. 19:11–12. But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
save they to whom it is given. For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from
their mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of  men:
and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of  heaven’s
sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.  1 Cor. 7:2,  9. Nevertheless, to
avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own
husband.… But if  they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to
burn.    Heb.  13:4.  Marriage  is  honourable  in  all,  and  the  bed  undefiled:  but
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.  Eph. 4:28. Let him that stole steal no
more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that
he may have to give to him that needeth.  1 Thess. 4:11–12. … and that ye study to
be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we com-
manded you; that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye
may have lack of  nothing.  1 Cor. 7:23. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the
servants of  men.

Of  the Civil Magistrate

1.  God, the supreme Lord and King of  all the world, hath or-
dained civil magistrates, to be, under him, over the people, for his
own glory, and the public good: and, to this end, hath armed them
with the power of  the sword, for the defense and encouragement of
them that are good, and for the punishment of  evildoers.a

2.  It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the office of  a
magistrate, when called thereunto:b in the managing whereof, as they

a.  Rom. 13:1–4. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
no power but of  God: the powers that be are ordained of  God. Whosoever therefore
resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of  God: and they that resist shall receive to
themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of  the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have
praise of  the same: for he is the minister of  God to thee for good. But if  thou do that
which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of
God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.  1 Pet. 2:13–14. Submit
yourselves to every ordinance of  man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as
supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of
evildoers, and for the praise of  them that do well.

b.   Gen.  41:39–43. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath
shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: thou shalt be over
my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne
will I be greater than thou. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
the land of  Egypt. And Pharaoh took off  his ring from his hand, and put it upon
Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of  fine linen, and put a gold chain about
his neck; and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried
before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of  Egypt.  Neh.
12:26. These were in the days of  Joiakim the son of  Jeshua, the son of  Jozadak, and
in the days of  Nehemiah the governor, and of  Ezra the priest, the scribe.  Neh. 13:15–
31. In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and
bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of
burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against
them in the day wherein they sold victuals.… And it came to pass, that when the gates
of  Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of
my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sab-
bath day.…  Dan. 2:48–49. Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him
many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of  Babylon, and chief
of  the governors over all the wise men of  Babylon. Then Daniel requested of  the king,
and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of  the province of
Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of  the king.  Prov. 8:15–16. By me kings reign,
and princes decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of  the

ought especially to maintain piety, justice, and peace, according to
the wholesome laws of  each commonwealth;c so, for that end, they
may lawfully, now under the new testament, wage war, upon just and
necessary occasion.d

3.  Civil magistrates may not assume to themselves the adminis-
tration  of   the  Word  and  sacraments;  or  the  power  of   the  keys
of  the kingdom of  heaven;e or, in the least, interfere in matters of

earth.  Rom. 13:1–4. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
no power but of  God: the powers that be are ordained of  God. Whosoever therefore
resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of  God: and they that resist shall receive to
themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of  the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have

which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of
God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

c.  Ps. 2:10–12. Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of  the
earth. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be
angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all
they that put their trust in him.  1 Tim. 2:2. [Pray] for kings, and for all that are in
authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.  Ps.
82:3–4. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver
the poor and needy: rid them out of  the hand of  the wicked.  2 Sam. 23:3. The God
of  Israel said, the Rock of  Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just,
ruling in the fear of  God.  1 Pet. 2:13. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of  man
for the Lord’s sake.…

d.  Luke 3:14. And the soldiers likewise demanded of  him, saying, And what
shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely;
and be content with your wages.  Rom. 13:4. For he is the minister of  God to thee for
good. But if  thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain:
for he is the minister of  God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
Matt. 8:9–10. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say
to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my
servant, Do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them
that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Acts 10:1–2. There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of
the band called the Italian band, a devout man, and one that feared God with all his
house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.

e.  2 Chron. 26:18. And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It

the sons of  Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of  the sanctuary; for
thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.  Matt.

hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  Matt.

faith.f  Yet,  as  nursing  fathers,  it  is  the  duty  of   civil  magistrates  to
protect the church of  our common Lord, without giving the prefer-
ence  to  any  denomination  of   Christians  above  the  rest,  in  such  a
manner that all ecclesiastical persons whatever shall enjoy the full,
free, and unquestioned liberty of  discharging every part of  their sa-
cred functions, without violence or danger.g And, as Jesus Christ hath
appointed a regular government and discipline in his church, no law
of  any commonwealth should interfere with, let, or hinder, the due
exercise thereof, among the voluntary members of  any denomination
of  Christians, according to their own profession and belief.h It is the

earth shall be loosed in heaven.  1 Cor. 12:28–29. And God hath set some in the
church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then
gifts of  healings, helps, governments, diversities of  tongues. Are all apostles? are all
prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of  miracles?  Eph. 4:11–12. And he gave
some,  apostles;  and  some,  prophets;  and  some,  evangelists;  and  some,  pastors  and
teachers; for the perfecting of  the saints, for the work of  the ministry, for the edifying
of  the body of  Christ.  1 Cor. 4:1–2. Let a man so account of  us, as of  the ministers
of  Christ, and stewards of  the mysteries of  God. Moreover it is required in stewards,
that a man be found faithful.  Rom. 10:15. And how shall they preach, except they
be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of  them that preach the gospel of
peace, and bring glad tidings of  good things!  Heb. 5:4. And no man taketh this
honour unto himself, but he that is called of  God, as was Aaron.

f.  John 18:36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of  this world: if  my kingdom
were of  this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the
Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.  Acts 5:29. Then Peter and the other
apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.  Eph. 4:11–12.
And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,
pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of  the saints, for the work of  the ministry, for
the edifying of  the body of  Christ.

g.  Isa. 49:23. And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nurs-
ing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up
the dust of  thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be
ashamed that wait for me.  Rom. 13:1–6. Let every soul be subject unto the higher
powers. For there is no power but of  God: the powers that be are ordained of  God.
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of  God: and they
that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good
works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of  the power? do that which is good,
and thou shalt have praise of  the same: for he is the minister of  God to thee for good.
But if  thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he
is the minister of  God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Where-
fore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For for
this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon
this very thing.

duty of  civil magistrates to protect the person and good name of  all
their people, in such an effectual manner as that no person be suf-
fered, either upon pretense of  religion or of  infidelity, to offer any
indignity, violence, abuse, or injury to any other person whatsoever:
and to take order, that all religious and ecclesiastical assemblies be
held without molestation or disturbance.i

4.  It is the duty of  people to pray for magistrates,k to honor their
persons,l to pay them tribute or other dues,m to obey their lawful com-
mands, and to be subject to their authority, for conscience’ sake.n
Infidelity, or difference in religion, doth not make void the magis-
trates’ just and legal authority, nor free the people from their due
obedience  to  them:o from  which  ecclesiastical  persons  are  not

kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty.

k.  1 Tim. 2:1–3. I exhort therefore, that, first of  all, supplications, prayers, inter-
cessions, and giving of  thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in
authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For
this is good and acceptable in the sight of  God our Saviour.

l.  1 Pet. 2:17. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the

king.

m.  Matt. 22:21. They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render
therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are
God’s.  Rom. 13:6–7. For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s minis-
ters, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues:
tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to
whom honour.

n.  Rom. 13:5. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
for conscience sake.  Titus 3:1. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and
powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work.

o.  1 Pet. 2:13–16. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of  man for the Lord’s
sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are
sent by him for the punishment of  evildoers, and for the praise of  them that do well.
For so is the will of  God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of
foolish men: as free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of  maliciousness, but as the
servants of  God.

p.  Rom. 13:1. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of  God: the powers that be are ordained of  God.  Acts 25:9–11. But
Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to
Jerusalem, and there be judged of  these things before me? Then said Paul, I stand at
Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong,

Of  Marriage and Divorce

1.  Marriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is
it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman
to have more than one husband, at the same time.a
as thou very well knowest. For if  I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy
of  death, I refuse not to die: but if  there be none of  these things whereof  these accuse
me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.  2 Pet. 2:1,  10–11. But
there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers
among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that
bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.… But chiefly them that
walk after the flesh in the lust of  uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous
are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of  dignities. Whereas angels, which
are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the
Lord.  Jude 8–11. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise domin-
ion, and speak evil of  dignities. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the
devil he disputed about the body of  Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accu-
sation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. But these speak evil of  those things which they
know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt
themselves. Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of  Cain, and ran greedily
after the error of  Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of  Core.

q.  Mark 10:42–44. But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know
that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them;
and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But so shall it not be among you:
but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of  you
will be the chiefest, shall be servant of  all.  Matt.  23:8–12. But be not ye called
Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man
your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye
called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you
shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself  shall be abased; and he that
shall humble himself  shall be exalted.  2 Tim. 2:24. And the servant of  the Lord
must  not  strive;  but  be  gentle  unto  all  men,  apt  to  teach,  patient.    1  Pet.  5:3.
… neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.

them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no

2.  Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of  husband and
wife,b for the increase of  mankind with legitimate issue, and of  the
church with an holy seed;c and for preventing of  uncleanness.d

3.  It is lawful for all sorts of  people to marry, who are able with
judgment to give their consent.e Yet it is the duty of  Christians to
marry only in the Lord.f And therefore such as profess the true re-
formed religion should not marry with infidels, papists, or other idola-
ters: neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by marry-
ing  with  such  as  are  notoriously  wicked  in  their  life,  or  maintain

more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.  Rom. 7:3. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another
man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if  her husband be dead, she is free from that
law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.  Prov. 2:17.
… which forsaketh the guide of  her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of  her God.
b.  Gen. 2:18. And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  Eph. 5:28. So ought men to love their
wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  1 Pet. 3:7. Likewise,
ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as
unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of  the grace of  life; that your
prayers be not hindered.

c.  Gen. 1:28. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of  the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the
earth.  Gen. 9:1. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruit-
ful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.  Mal. 2:15. And did not he make one? Yet
had he the residue of  the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed.
Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of
his youth.

d.  1 Cor. 7:2,  9. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
wife, and let every woman have her own husband.… But if  they cannot contain, let
them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

e.    Heb.  13:4.  Marriage  is  honourable  in  all,  and  the  bed  undefiled:  but
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.  1 Tim. 4:3. … forbidding to marry,
and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with
thanksgiving of  them which believe and know the truth.  1 Cor. 7:36–38. But if  any
man think that he behaveth himself  uncomely toward his virgin, if  she pass the flower
of  her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them
marry. Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath
power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin,
doeth well. So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her
not in marriage doeth better.  Gen. 24:57–58. And they said, We will call the damsel,
and inquire at her mouth. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go
with this man? And she said, I will go.

f.  1 Cor. 7:39. The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if
her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.

4.  Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of  consanguinity
or affinity forbidden by the Word.h Nor can such incestuous mar-
riages ever be made lawful by any law of  man or consent of  parties,
so as those persons may live together as man and wife.i

5.  Adultery or fornication committed after a contract, being de-
tected before marriage, giveth just occasion to the innocent party to
dissolve that contract.k In the case of  adultery after marriage, it is

g.  Gen. 34:14. And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us. Ex. 34:16. And
thou take of  their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after
their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.  2 Cor. 6:14. Be ye not
unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with
unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?  See Deut. 7:3–4;
1 Kings 11:4; Neh. 13:25–27; Mal. 2:11–12.

h.  Lev. 18:6–17,  24–30. None of  you shall approach to any that is near of  kin
to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD. The nakedness of  thy father, or the
nakedness of  thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
uncover her nakedness. The nakedness of  thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is
thy  father’s  nakedness. The  nakedness  of   thy  sister,  the  daughter  of   thy  father,  or
daughter of  thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their
nakedness thou shalt not uncover.… Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye
commit not any one of  these abominable customs, which were committed before you,
and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.  Lev. 20:19. And
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of  thy mother’s sister, nor of  thy father’s sister:
for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.  1 Cor. 5:1. It is reported
commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much
as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.  Amos 2:7.
… that pant after the dust of  the earth on the head of  the poor, and turn aside the way
of  the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my
holy name.

i.  Mark 6:18. For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy
brother’s wife.  Lev. 18:24–28. Defile not ye yourselves in any of  these things: for in
all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: and the land is defiled:
therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof  upon it, and the land itself  vomiteth out her
inhabitants. Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not com-
mit any of  these abominations; neither any of  your own nation, nor any stranger that
sojourneth among you.…

k.  Matt. 1:18–20. Now the birth of  Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
child of  the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing
to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he
thought on these things, behold, the angel of  the Lord appeared unto him in a dream,
saying, Joseph, thou son of  David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
which is conceived in her is of  the Holy Ghost.  See Deut. 22:23–24.

lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce:l and, after the di-

6.  Although the corruption of  man be such as is apt to study
arguments unduly to put asunder those whom God hath joined to-
gether in marriage: yet, nothing but adultery, or such willful deser-
tion as can no way be remedied by the church, or civil magistrate, is
cause sufficient of  dissolving the bond of  marriage:n wherein, a pub-
lic and orderly course of  proceeding is to be observed; and the per-
sons concerned in it not left to their own wills, and discretion, in their
own case.o

Of  the Church

l.  Matt. 5:31–32. It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
give her a writing of  divorcement: but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away
his  wife,  saving  for  the  cause  of   fornication,  causeth  her  to  commit  adultery:  and
whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.

m.  Matt. 19:9. And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it
be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth
her which is put away doth commit adultery.  Rom. 7:2–3. For the woman which
hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if  the
husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of  her husband. So then if, while her
husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if
her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she
be married to another man.

n.  Matt. 19:8–9. He saith unto them, Moses because of  the hardness of  your
hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. And
I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and
shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away
doth commit adultery.  1 Cor. 7:15. But if  the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A
brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.
Matt. 19:6. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

o.  Deut. 24:1–4. When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come
to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in
her: then let him write her a bill of  divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her
out of  his house. And when she is departed out of  his house, she may go and be
another man’s wife. And if  the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of  divorce-
ment, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of  his house; or if  the latter

husband die, which took her to be his wife; her former husband, which sent her away,
may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination
before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God
giveth thee for an inheritance.

a.  Eph. 1:10,  22–23. … that in the dispensation of  the fulness of  times he might
gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on
earth; even in him.… and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of  him that filleth all
in all.  Eph. 5:23,  27,  32. For the husband is the head of  the wife, even as Christ is
the head of  the church: and he is the saviour of  the body.… that he might present it to
himself  a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it
should be holy and without blemish.… This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning
Christ and the church.  Col. 1:18. And he is the head of  the body, the church: who is
the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preemi-
nence.

b.  1 Cor. 1:2. … unto the church of  God which is at Corinth, to them that are
sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the
name of  Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours. 1 Cor. 12:12–13. For as the
body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of  that one body, being
many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one
body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all
made to drink into one Spirit.  Ps. 2:8. Ask of  me, and I shall give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of  the earth for thy possession. Rev.
7:9. After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of  all
nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before
the  Lamb,  clothed  with  white  robes,  and  palms  in  their  hands.   Rom.  15:9–12.
… and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause
I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. And again he saith,
Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and
laud him, all ye people. And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of  Jesse, and he
that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.

c.  1 Cor. 7:14. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but
now are they holy.  Acts 2:39. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and
to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  Gen. 17:7–12.
And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their
generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after
thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a
stranger, all the land of  Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

Christ,d the house and family of  God,e out of  which there is no ordi-
nary possibility of  salvation.f

3.  Unto this catholic visible church Christ hath given the minis-
try, oracles, and ordinances of  God, for the gathering and perfecting
of  the saints, in this life, to the end of  the world: and doth, by his own
presence and Spirit, according to his promise, make them effectual
thereunto.g
And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy
seed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between
me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
And ye shall circumcise the flesh of  your foreskin; and it shall be a token of  the cov-
enant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among
you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with
money of  any stranger, which is not of  thy seed.  Ezek. 16:20–21. Moreover thou
hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast
thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of  thy whoredoms a small matter,
that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the
fire for them?  Rom. 11:16. For if  the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if
the root be holy, so are the branches.  See Gal. 3:7,  9,  14; Rom. 4:12,  16,  24.

d.  Matt. 13:47. Again, the kingdom of  heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
into the sea, and gathered of  every kind.  Isa. 9:7. Of  the increase of  his government
and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of  David, and upon his kingdom, to
order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for
ever. The zeal of  the LORD of  hosts will perform this.  Luke 1:32–33. He shall be
great, and shall be called the Son of  the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto
him the throne of  his father David: and he shall reign over the house of  Jacob for ever;
and of  his kingdom there shall be no end.  Acts 2:30–36. Therefore being a prophet,
and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of  the fruit of  his loins,
according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this
before spake of  the resurrection of  Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his
flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof  we all are witnesses.
Therefore being by the right hand of  God exalted, and having received of  the Father
the promise of  the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. For
David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my
Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore let all
the house of  Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye
have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  Col. 1:13. … who hath delivered us from the
power of  darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of  his dear Son.

e.  Eph. 2:19. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-
citizens with the saints, and of  the household of  God.  Eph. 3:15. … [the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,] of  whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.

f.  Acts 2:47. [All that believed were] praising God, and having favour with all

the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

g.  1 Cor. 12:28. And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of  healings, helps, govern-
ments, diversities of  tongues.  Eph. 4:11–13. And he gave some, apostles; and some,

come in the unity of  the faith, and of  the knowledge of  the Son of  God, unto a perfect
man, unto the measure of  the stature of  the fulness of  Christ.  Matt. 28:19–20. Go

the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of  the world. Amen.
Isa.  59:12.  For  our  transgressions  are  multiplied  before  thee,  and  our  sins  testify
against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them.
h.  Rom. 11:3–5. … Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine
altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of  God
unto him? I have reserved to myself  seven thousand men, who have not bowed the
knee to the image of  Baal. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
according to the election of  grace.  Acts 9:31. Then had the churches rest through-
out all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of
the Lord, and in the comfort of  the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.  Acts 2:41,  47.
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were
added unto them about three thousand souls.… [All that believed were] praising God,
and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as
should be saved.  Acts 18:8–10. And Crispus, the chief  ruler of  the synagogue, be-
lieved on the Lord with all his house; and many of  the Corinthians hearing believed,
and were baptized. Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid,
but speak, and hold not thy peace: for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to
hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.

i.  Acts 2:41–42. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they contin-
ued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of  bread, and
in prayers.  1 Cor. 5:6–7. Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new
lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.  Rev. 2–3.
Unto the angel of  the church of  Ephesus write … I know thy works, and thy labour,
and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast
tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars.…
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.… And

now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.  Rev. 2–3. See
footnote i above.  Matt. 13:24–30,  47. Another parable put he forth unto them,
saying, The kingdom of  heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his
field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and
went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then ap-
peared the tares also. So the servants of  the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto
them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go
and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in
bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.… Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of  every kind.

l.  Matt. 23:37–39. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me
henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of  the Lord.  Rom.
11:18–22. Boast not against the branches. But if  thou boast, thou bearest not the
root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
be graffed in. Well; because of  unbelief  they were broken off, and thou standest by
faith. Be not highminded, but fear: for if  God spared not the natural branches, take
heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of  God:
on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if  thou continue in his good-
ness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master,
even Christ.  1 Pet. 5:2–4. Feed the flock of  God which is among you, taking the
oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of  a ready
mind; neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
And when the chief  Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of  glory that
fadeth not away.

a.  1 John 1:3. That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye
also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with
his Son Jesus Christ.  Eph. 3:16–18. … that he would grant you, according to the
riches of  his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that
Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
and height.  John 1:16. And of  his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
Eph. 2:5–6. Even when we were dead in sins, [God] hath quickened us together with
Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit to-
gether in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.  Phil. 3:10. …that I may know him, and the
power of  his resurrection, and the fellowship of  his sufferings, being made conform-
able unto his death.  Rom. 6:5–6. For if  we have been planted together in the like-
ness of  his death, we shall be also in the likeness of  his resurrection: knowing this, that
our old man is crucified with him, that the body of  sin might be destroyed, that hence-
forth we should not serve sin.  Rom. 8:17. … and if  children, then heirs; heirs of
God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if  so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also
glorified together.  2 Tim. 2:12. If  we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if  we deny
him, he also will deny us.

love, they have communion in each other’s gifts and graces,b and are
obliged to the performance of  such duties, public and private, as do
conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.c
2.  Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship
and communion in the worship of  God, and in performing such other
spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification;d as also in reliev-
ing each other in outward things, according to their several abilities
and necessities. Which communion, as God offereth opportunity, is
to be extended unto all those who, in every place, call upon the name

b.  Eph. 4:15–16. … but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together
and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working
in the measure of  every part, maketh increase of  the body unto the edifying of  itself  in
love.  1 Cor. 12:7,  12. But the manifestation of  the Spirit is given to every man to
profit withal.… For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members
of   that  one  body,  being  many,  are  one  body:  so  also  is  Christ.    1  Cor.  3:21–23.
Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos,
or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
yours; and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.  Col. 2:19. … and not holding the
Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered,
and knit together, increaseth with the increase of  God.

c.  1 Thess. 5:11,  14. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one
another,  even  as  also  ye  do.…  Now  we  exhort  you,  brethren,  warn  them  that  are
unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.  Rom.
1:11–12,  14. For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to
the end ye may be established; that is, that I may be comforted together with you by
the mutual faith both of  you and me.… I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the
Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.  1 John 3:16–18. Hereby perceive
we the love of  God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our
lives for the brethren. But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have
need, and shutteth up his bowels of  compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of
God in him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed
and in truth.  Gal. 6:10. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
men, especially unto them who are of  the household of  faith.

d.  Heb. 10:24–25. And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
good  works:  not  forsaking  the  assembling  of   ourselves  together,  as  the  manner  of
some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day ap-
proaching.  Acts 2:42,  46. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and
fellowship, and in breaking of  bread, and in prayers.… And they, continuing daily
with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their
meat with gladness and singleness of  heart.  Isa. 2:3. And many people shall go and
say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of  the LORD, to the house of  the God
of  Jacob; and he will teach us of  his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of  Zion
shall go forth the law, and the word of  the LORD from Jerusalem.  1 Cor. 11:20.
When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.

3.  This communion which the saints have with Christ, doth not
make them in any wise partakers of  the substance of  his Godhead;
or to be equal with Christ in any respect: either of  which to affirm is
impious  and  blasphemous.f  Nor  doth  their  communion  one  with
another, as saints, take away, or infringe the title or propriety which
each man hath in his goods and possessions.g

e.  1 John 3:17. But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have
need, and shutteth up his bowels of  compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of
God in him?  2 Cor. 8–9. Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of  the grace of  God
bestowed on the churches of  Macedonia; how that in a great trial of  affliction the
abundance  of   their  joy  and  their  deep  poverty  abounded  unto  the  riches  of   their
liberality.… Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowl-
edge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace
also.… For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: but by an equality,
that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abun-
dance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality.… For the ad-
ministration of  this service not only supplieth the want of  the saints, but is abundant
also by many thanksgivings unto God; whiles by the experiment of  this ministration
they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of  Christ, and for your
liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men.  Acts 11:29–30. Then the disciples,
every man according to his ability, determined to send relief  unto the brethren which
dwelt in Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of  Barnabas
and Saul.  See Acts 2:44–45.

f.  Col. 1:18–19. And he is the head of  the body, the church: who is the begin-
ning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.  1 Cor. 8:6. But to us
there is but one God, the Father, of  whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.  Ps. 45:6–7. Thy throne, O God,
is for ever and ever: the sceptre of  thy kingdom is a right sceptre. Thou lovest righ-
teousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the
oil of  gladness above thy fellows.  Heb. 1:6–9. And again, when he bringeth in the
firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of  God worship him. And
of  the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of  fire.
But  unto  the  Son  he  saith, Thy  throne,  O  God,  is  for  ever  and  ever:  a  sceptre  of
righteousness is the sceptre of  thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated
iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of  gladness
above thy fellows.  John 1:14. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
(and we beheld his glory, the glory as of  the only begotten of  the Father,) full of  grace
and truth.  John 20:17. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended
to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and
your Father; and to my God, and your God.

g.  Ex. 20:15. Thou shalt not steal.  Eph. 4:28. Let him that stole steal no more:
but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may
have to give to him that needeth.  Acts 5:4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own?
and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing

Of the Sacraments

1.  Sacraments are holy signs and seals of  the covenant of  grace,a
immediately instituted by God,b to represent Christ, and his benefits;
and to confirm our interest in him:c as also, to put a visible difference
between those that belong unto the church, and the rest of  the world;d
and solemnly to engage them to the service of  God in Christ, accord-
ing to his Word.e

in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

a.  Rom. 4:11. And he received the sign of  circumcision, a seal of  the righteous-
ness of  the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of
all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be
imputed unto them also.  Gen. 17:7,  10–11. And I will establish my covenant be-
tween me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting cov-
enant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.… This is my covenant, which
ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among
you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of  your foreskin; and it shall
be a token of  the covenant betwixt me and you.

b.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.  1 Cor. 11:23. For I have
received of  the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the
same night in which he was betrayed took bread.

c.  Rom. 6:3–4. Know ye not, that so many of  us as were baptized into Jesus
Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of  the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of  life.  Col. 2:12. … buried with him in
baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of  the operation of  God,
who hath raised him from the dead.  1 Cor. 10:16. The cup of  blessing which we
bless, is it not the communion of  the blood of  Christ? The bread which we break, is it
not the communion of  the body of  Christ?  1 Cor. 11:25–26. After the same manner
also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my
blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me. For as often as ye eat this
bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  Gal. 3:27. For as
many of  you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

d.  Ex. 12:48. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and
keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person
shall eat thereof.  Gen. 34:14. And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to
give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.  1 Cor.
10:21. Ye cannot drink the cup of  the Lord, and the cup of  devils: ye cannot be
partakers of  the Lord’s table, and of  the table of  devils.

e.  Rom. 6:3–4. Know ye not, that so many of  us as were baptized into Jesus

2.  There is, in every sacrament, a spiritual relation, or sacramen-
tal union, between the sign and the thing signified: whence it comes
to pass, that the names and effects of  the one are attributed to the
other.f

3.  The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments rightly
used, is not conferred by any power in them; neither doth the effi-
cacy of  a sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of  him that
doth administer it:g but upon the work of  the Spirit,h and the word
of  institution, which contains, together with a precept authorizing
the use thereof, a promise of  benefit to worthy receivers.i

Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of  the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of  life.  Gal. 3:27. For as many of  you as have
been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  1 Pet. 3:21. The like figure whereunto
even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of  the filth of  the flesh, but
the answer of  a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of  Jesus Christ.
1 Cor. 10:16. The cup of  blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of  the
blood of  Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of  the body of
Christ?  See 1 Cor. 5:7–8.

f.  Gen. 17:10. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.  Matt.
26:27–28. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink
ye all of  it; for this is my blood of  the new testament, which is shed for many for the
remission of  sins.  1 Cor. 10:16–18. The cup of  blessing which we bless, is it not the
communion of  the blood of  Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the commun-
ion of  the body of  Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are
all partakers of  that one bread. Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of
the sacrifices partakers of  the altar?

g.  Rom. 2:28–29. For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and
circumcision is that of  the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not
of  men, but of  God.  1 Pet. 3:21. The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also
now save us (not the putting away of  the filth of  the flesh, but the answer of  a good
conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of  Jesus Christ.

h.  1 Cor. 12:13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into
one Spirit.

i.  Matt. 26:26–28. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took
the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of  it; for this is my
blood of  the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of  sins.  Luke
22:19–20. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them,
saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of  me. Like-
wise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood,

4.  There be only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in
the gospel; that is to say, baptism, and the Supper of  the Lord: nei-
ther  of   which  may  be  dispensed  by  any,  but  by  a  minister  of   the
Word lawfully ordained.k

5.  The sacraments of  the old testament, in regard of  the spiritual
things thereby signified and exhibited, were, for substance, the same
with those of  the new.l

Chapter 28
Of  Baptism

1.  Baptism is a sacrament of  the new testament, ordained by
Jesus Christ,a not only for the solemn admission of  the party bap-

which is shed for you.  Matt. 28:19–20. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, bap-
tizing them in the name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: teach-
ing them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with
you alway, even unto the end of  the world. Amen.  1 Cor. 11:26. For as often as ye eat
this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.

k.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.  1 Cor. 11:20,  23. When
ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.… For I
have received of  the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus
the same night in which he was betrayed took bread.   1  Cor.  4:1. Let a man so
account of  us, as of  the ministers of  Christ, and stewards of  the mysteries of  God.
Eph. 4:11–12. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evange-
lists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of  the saints, for the work of
the ministry, for the edifying of  the body of  Christ.

l.  1 Cor. 10:1–4. Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were
all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual
meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of  that spiritual Rock
that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.  Rom. 4:11. And he received the sign
of  circumcision, a seal of  the righteousness of  the faith which he had yet being uncir-
cumcised: that he might be the father of  all them that believe, though they be not
circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also.  Col. 2:11–12.
… in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in
putting off  the body of  the sins of  the flesh by the circumcision of  Christ: buried with
him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of  the operation
of  God, who hath raised him from the dead.

a.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the

name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.

tized into the visible church;b but also, to be unto him a sign and seal
of   the  covenant  of   grace,c  of   his  ingrafting  into  Christ,d  of
regeneration,e of  remission of  sins,f and of  his giving up unto God,
through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of  life.g Which sacrament is,
by Christ’s own appointment, to be continued in his church until the
end of  the world.h

2.  The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water,
wherewith the party is to be baptized, in the name of  the Father, and
of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost, by a minister of  the gospel, law-
fully called thereunto.i

b.  1 Cor. 12:13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into
one Spirit.  Gal. 3:27–28. For as many of  you as have been baptized into Christ have
put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

c.  Rom. 4:11. And he received the sign of  circumcision, a seal of  the righteous-
ness of  the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of
all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be
imputed unto them also.  Col. 2:11–12. … in whom also ye are circumcised with the
circumcision made without hands, in putting off  the body of  the sins of  the flesh by
the circumcision of  Christ: buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
him through the faith of  the operation of  God, who hath raised him from the dead.
d.  Gal. 3:27. For as many of  you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ.  Rom. 6:5. For if  we have been planted together in the likeness of  his death,
we shall be also in the likeness of  his resurrection.

e.  John 3:5. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
of  water and of  the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of  God.  Titus 3:5. Not
by works of  righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us,
by the washing of  regeneration, and renewing of  the Holy Ghost.

f.   Mark  1:4.  John  did  baptize  in  the  wilderness,  and  preach  the  baptism  of
repentance for the remission of  sins.  Acts 2:38. Then Peter said unto them, Repent,
and be baptized every one of  you in the name of  Jesus Christ for the remission of  sins,
and ye shall receive the gift of  the Holy Ghost.  Acts 22:16. And now why tarriest
thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of  the Lord.
g.  Rom. 6:3–4. Know ye not, that so many of  us as were baptized into Jesus
Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of  the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of  life.

h.  Matt. 28:19–20. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto
the end of  the world. Amen.

i.  Acts 10:47. Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  Acts 8:36,  38. And as they went
on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water;

3.    Dipping  of   the  person  into  the  water  is  not  necessary;  but
baptism is rightly administered by pouring, or sprinkling water upon
the person.k

unto Christ,l but also the infants of  one, or both, believing parents,
are to be baptized.m

what doth hinder me to be baptized?… And he commanded the chariot to stand still:
and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized
him.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.

k.  Heb. 9:10,  13,  19,  21. … which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers
washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of  reformation.…
For if  the blood of  bulls and of  goats, and the ashes of  an heifer sprinkling the un-
clean, sanctifieth to the purifying of  the flesh … For when Moses had spoken every
precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of  calves and of  goats,
with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the
people.… Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of
the ministry.  Mark 7:2–4. And when they saw some of  his disciples eat bread with
defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. For the Pharisees, and
all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of  the
elders. And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And
many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of  cups,
and pots, brasen vessels, and of  tables.  Luke 11:38. And when the Pharisee saw it, he
marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.

l.  Acts 2:41. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  Acts 8:12–13.
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of  God,
and the name of  Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Then Simon
himself  believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and won-
dered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.  Acts 16:14–15. And a
certain woman named Lydia, a seller of  purple, of  the city of  Thyatira, which wor-
shipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the
things which were spoken of  Paul. And when she was baptized, and her household,
she besought us, saying, If  ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my
house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

m.  Gen. 17:7–14. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and
thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto
thee, and to thy seed after thee.… This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between
me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
And ye shall circumcise the flesh of  your foreskin; and it shall be a token of  the cov-
enant betwixt me and you.… And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of  his
foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off  from his people; he hath broken
my covenant.  Gal. 3:9,  14. So then they which be of  faith are blessed with faithful
Abraham.… that the blessing of  Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
Christ; that we might receive the promise of  the Spirit through faith. Col. 2:11–12.

him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of  the operation
of  God, who hath raised him from the dead.  Acts 2:38–39. Then Peter said unto
them, Repent, and be baptized every one of  you in the name of  Jesus Christ for the
remission of  sins, and ye shall receive the gift of  the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord
our God shall call.  Rom. 4:11–12. And he received the sign of  circumcision, a seal
of  the righteousness of  the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might
be the father of  all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteous-
ness might be imputed unto them also: and the father of  circumcision to them who are
not of  the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of  that faith of  our father
Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.  Matt. 19:13. Then were there
brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and
the disciples rebuked them.  Mark 10:13–16. And they brought young children to
him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of  such is the kingdom of  God.
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of  God as a little child,
he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them,
and blessed them.  Luke 18:15–17. And they brought unto him also infants, that he
would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called
them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not:
for of  such is the kingdom of  God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive
the kingdom of  God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.  Matt. 28:19. Go
ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of  the Father, and of
the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.  1 Cor. 7:14. For the unbelieving husband is sancti-
fied by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your
children unclean; but now are they holy.

n.  Gen. 17:14. And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of  his foreskin is
not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off  from his people; he hath broken my cov-
enant.  Matt. 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of  the Father, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost.  Acts 2:38. Then Peter
said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of  you in the name of  Jesus Christ
for the remission of  sins, and ye shall receive the gift of  the Holy Ghost.  See Luke
7:30.

o.  Rom. 4:11. And he received the sign of  circumcision, a seal of  the righteous-
ness of  the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of
all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be
imputed unto them also.  Acts 10:2,  4,  22,  31,  45,  47. … a devout man, and one
that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to
God alway.… And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?
And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before
God.… And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God,

that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.p

6.  The efficacy of  baptism is not tied to that moment of  time
wherein it is administered;q yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of
this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really ex-
hibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of  age
or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of
God’s own will, in his appointed time.r

7.  The sacrament of  baptism is but once to be administered unto

any person.s

and of  good report among all the nation of  the Jews, was warned from God by an holy
angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of  thee.… And said, Corne-
lius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of  God.…
And they of  the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with
Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of  the Holy Ghost.…
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the
Holy Ghost as well as we?

p.  Acts 8:13,  23. Then Simon himself  believed also: and when he was baptized,
he  continued  with  Philip,  and  wondered,  beholding  the  miracles  and  signs  which
were done.… For I perceive that thou art in the gall of  bitterness, and in the bond of
iniquity.

q.  John 3:5,  8. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be
born of  water and of  the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of  God.… The
wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of  the Spirit.

r.  Rom. 6:3–6. Know ye not, that so many of  us as were baptized into Jesus
Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of  the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of  life. For if  we have been planted together in
the likeness of  his death, we shall be also in the likeness of  his resurrection: knowing
this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of  sin might be destroyed,
that henceforth we should not serve sin.  Gal. 3:27. For as many of  you as have been
baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  1 Pet. 3:21. The like figure whereunto even
baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of  the filth of  the flesh, but the
answer of  a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of  Jesus Christ.  Acts
2:38,  41. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of  you in
the name of  Jesus Christ for the remission of  sins, and ye shall receive the gift of  the
Holy Ghost.… Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same
day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.

s.  Rom. 6:3–11. Know ye not, that so many of  us as were baptized into Jesus
Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of  the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of  life. For if  we have been planted together in
the likeness of  his death, we shall be also in the likeness of  his resurrection: knowing
this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of  sin might be destroyed,
that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if  we

Chapter 29

Of  the Lord’s Supper

1.  Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein he was betrayed, insti-
tuted the sacrament of  his body and blood, called the Lord’s Supper,
to be observed in his church, unto the end of  the world, for the per-
petual remembrance of  the sacrifice of  himself  in his death; the seal-
ing all benefits thereof  unto true believers, their spiritual nourish-
ment and growth in him, their further engagement in and to all du-
ties which they owe unto him; and, to be a bond and pledge of  their
communion with him, and with each other, as members of  his mys-
tical body.a

2.  In this sacrament, Christ is not offered up to his Father; nor
any real sacrifice made at all, for remission of  sins of  the quick or
dead;b but only a commemoration of  that one offering up of  himself,

be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: knowing that Christ
being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

a.  1 Cor. 11:23–26. For I have received of  the Lord that which also I delivered
unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which
is broken for you: this do in remembrance of  me. After the same manner also he took
the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this
do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and
drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  1 Cor. 10:16–17,  21. The
cup of  blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of  the blood of  Christ? The
bread which we break, is it not the communion of  the body of  Christ? For we being
many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of  that one bread.… Ye
cannot drink the cup of  the Lord, and the cup of  devils: ye cannot be partakers of  the
Lord’s table, and of  the table of  devils.  1 Cor. 12:13. For by one Spirit are we all
baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free;
and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.

b.  Heb. 9:22,  25–26,  28.  And almost all things are by the law purged with
blood; and without shedding of  blood is no remission.… Nor yet that he should offer
himself  often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of
others; for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of  the world: but now
once in the end of  the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself.… So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of  many; and unto them that
look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.  Heb. 10:10–
14. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of  the body of  Jesus

CHAPTER 29

by himself, upon the cross, once for all: and a spiritual oblation of  all
possible praise unto God, for the same:c so that the popish sacrifice
of  the Mass (as they call it) is most abominably injurious to Christ’s
one, only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of  his elect.d
3.  The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his minis-
ters to declare his word of  institution to the people; to pray, and bless
the elements of  bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from
a common to an holy use; and to take and break the bread, to take
the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to
the  communicants;e  but  to  none  who  are  not  then  present  in  the

Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man, after he had offered
one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of  God; from henceforth
expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected
for ever them that are sanctified.

c.  1 Cor. 11:24–26. And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of  me. After the
same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new
testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me. For as
often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.
Matt. 26:26–27. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake
it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup,
and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of  it.  Luke 22:19–20. And
he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my
body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of  me. Likewise also the cup after
supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

d.  Heb. 7:23–24,  27. And they truly were many priests, because they were not
suffered to continue by reason of  death: but this man, because he continueth ever,
hath an unchangeable priesthood.… who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to
offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once,
when he offered up himself.  Heb. 10:11–12,  14,  18. And every priest standeth daily
ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
sins: but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the
right hand of  God.… For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified.… Now where remission of  these is, there is no more offering for sin.

e.  Matt. 26:26–28. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,
and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he
took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of  it; for this is
my blood of  the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of  sins.
Mark 14:22–24. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and
gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he
had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of  it. And he said unto them,
This is my blood of  the new testament, which is shed for many.  Luke 22:19–20. And
he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my
body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of  me. Likewise also the cup after

4.  Private Masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or any
other, alone;g as likewise, the denial of  the cup to the people,h wor-
shiping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about, for
adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use;
are all contrary to the nature of  this sacrament, and to the institution
of  Christ.i

5.  The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the
uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that,
truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name
of  the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of  Christ;k
supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
1 Cor. 10:16–17. The cup of  blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of  the
blood of  Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of  the body of
Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of
that one bread.  1 Cor. 11:23–27. For I have received of  the Lord that which also I
delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body,
which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of  me. After the same manner also
he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my
blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me. For as often as ye eat this
bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come. Wherefore whoso-
ever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of  the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of
the body and blood of  the Lord.

f.  Acts 20:7. And upon the first day of  the week, when the disciples came to-
gether to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and
continued his speech until midnight.  1 Cor. 11:20. When ye come together there-
fore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.

g.  1 Cor. 10:16. The cup of  blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
the blood of  Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of  the body
of  Christ?

h.  Matt. 26:27–28. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of  it; for this is my blood of  the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of  sins.  Mark 14:23. And he took the cup, and when he had
given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of  it.  1 Cor. 11:25–29. After the
same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new
testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me. For as
often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of  the Lord, unworthily,
shall be guilty of  the body and blood of  the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and
so let him eat of  that bread, and drink of  that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
i.  Matt. 15:9. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the com-

mandments of men.

k.  Matt. 26:26–28. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,

CHAPTER 29

albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread
and wine, as they were before.l

6.  That doctrine which maintains a change of  the substance of
bread and wine, into the substance of  Christ’s body and blood (com-
monly called transubstantiation) by consecration of  a priest, or by
any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to com-
mon sense, and reason; overthroweth the nature of  the sacrament,
and hath been, and is, the cause of  manifold superstitions; yea, of
gross idolatries.m

7.  Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of  the visible elements,
in this sacrament,n do then also, inwardly by faith, really and indeed,
yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive, and feed upon,
Christ crucified, and all benefits of  his death: the body and blood of
Christ being then, not corporally or carnally, in, with, or under the
bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of
believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their
outward senses.o

8.  Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward ele-
ments  in  this  sacrament;  yet,  they  receive  not  the  thing  signified
and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he
took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of  it; for this is
my blood of  the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of  sins.

l.  1 Cor. 11:26–28. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
shew the Lord’s death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and
drink this cup of  the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of  the body and blood of  the
Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of  that bread, and drink of
that cup.  Matt. 26:29. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of  this fruit of
the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.

m.  Acts 3:21. … whom the heaven must receive until the times of  restitution of
all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of  all his holy prophets since the
world began.  1 Cor. 11:24–26. And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of  me.
After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is
the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of  me.
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he
come.  Luke 24:6,  39. He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you
when he was yet in Galilee.… Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle
me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

n.  1 Cor. 11:28. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of  that bread,

and drink of  that cup.

o.  1 Cor. 10:16. The cup of  blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
the blood of  Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of  the body
of  Christ?  See 1 Cor. 10:3–4.

thereby; but, by their unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of  the
body and blood of  the Lord, to their own damnation. Wherefore, all
ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion
with him, so are they unworthy of  the Lord’s table; and cannot, with-
out great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake of  these
holy mysteries,p or be admitted thereunto.q

Chapter 30

Of  Church Censures

1.  The Lord Jesus, as King and Head of  his church, hath therein
appointed a government, in the hand of  church officers, distinct from
the civil magistrate.a

p.  1 Cor. 11:27–29. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this
cup of  the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of  the body and blood of  the Lord. But let
a man examine himself, and so let him eat of  that bread, and drink of  that cup. For he
that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
discerning the Lord’s body.  2 Cor. 6:14–16. Be ye not unequally yoked together with
unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or
what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple
of  God with idols? for ye are the temple of  the living God; as God hath said, I will
dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
1 Cor. 10:21. Ye cannot drink the cup of  the Lord, and the cup of  devils: ye cannot
be partakers of  the Lord’s table, and of  the table of  devils.

q.  1 Cor. 5:6–7,  13. Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new
lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.… But
them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that
wicked person.  2 Thess. 3:6,  14–15. Now we command you, brethren, in the name
of  our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of  us.… And if  any man obey
not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he
may be ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
Matt. 7:6. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.

a.  Isa. 9:6–7. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the govern-
ment shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller,
The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of  Peace. Of  the increase of  his
government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of  David, and upon his
kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from hence-
forth even for ever. The zeal of  the LORD of  hosts will perform this.  Col. 1:18. And

2.  To these officers the keys of  the kingdom of  heaven are com-
mitted; by virtue whereof, they have power, respectively, to retain,
and remit sins; to shut that kingdom against the impenitent, both by
the Word, and censures; and to open it unto penitent sinners, by the
ministry of  the gospel; and by absolution from censures, as occasion
shall require.b

3.  Church censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining
of  offending brethren, for deterring of  others from the like offenses,
for purging out of  that leaven which might infect the whole lump, for
vindicating the honor of  Christ, and the holy profession of  the gos-

he is the head of  the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the
dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.  1 Tim. 5:17. Let the elders
that rule well be counted worthy of  double honour, especially they who labour in the
word and doctrine.  1 Thess. 5:12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them
which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you.  Acts
20:17,  28. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of  the church.…
Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy
Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of  God, which he hath purchased
with his own blood.  Heb. 13:7,  17,  24. Remember them which have the rule over
you, who have spoken unto you the word of  God: whose faith follow, considering the
end of  their conversation.… Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your-
selves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do
it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.… Salute all them that
have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of  Italy salute you.  Eph. 4:11–12.
And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,
pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of  the saints, for the work of  the ministry, for
the edifying of  the body of  Christ.  1 Cor. 12:28. And God hath set some in the
church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then
gifts of  healings, helps, governments, diversities of  tongues.  Matt. 28:18–20. And
Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in
earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of  the Fa-
ther, and of  the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
the world. Amen.  John 18:36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of  this world: if
my kingdom were of  this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

b.  Matt. 16:19. And I will give unto thee the keys of  the kingdom of  heaven:
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  Matt. 18:17–18. And if  he shall
neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if  he neglect to hear the church, let
him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, Whatso-
ever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven.  John 20:21–23. Then said Jesus to them again,
Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had
said  this,  he  breathed  on  them,  and  saith  unto  them,  Receive  ye  the  Holy  Ghost:

pel,  and  for  preventing  the  wrath  of   God,  which  might  justly  fall
upon the church, if  they should suffer his covenant, and the seals
thereof, to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders.c

4.  For the better attaining of  these ends, the officers of  the church
are to proceed by admonition; suspension from the sacrament of  the
Lord’s Supper for a season; and by excommunication from the church;
according to the nature of  the crime, and demerit of  the person.d

whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye
retain, they are retained.  2 Cor. 2:6–8. Sufficient to such a man is this punishment,
which was inflicted of  many. So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and
comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.

c.  1 Cor. 5:1–13. It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you,
and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should
have his father’s wife.… For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged
already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, in the
name of  our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the
power of  our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction
of  the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of  the Lord Jesus. Your glorying is
not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?… But now I
have written unto you not to keep company, if  any man that is called a brother be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner;
with such an one no not to eat. For what have I to do to judge them also that are
without? do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God judgeth.
Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.  1 Tim. 5:20. Them
that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.  Matt. 7:6. Give not that which is
holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them
under their feet, and turn again and rend you.  1 Tim. 1:20. Of  whom is Hymenaeus
and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blas-
pheme.  1 Cor. 11:27–34. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this
cup of  the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of  the body and blood of  the Lord. But let
a man examine himself, and so let him eat of  that bread, and drink of  that cup. For he
that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
discerning the Lord’s body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and
many sleep. For if  we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.…  Jude 23.
And others save with fear, pulling them out of  the fire; hating even the garment spot-
ted by the flesh.

d.  1 Thess. 5:12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour
among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you.  2 Thess. 3:6,  14–15.
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of  our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye with-
draw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition
which he received of  us.… And if  any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count him not as
an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.  1 Cor. 5:4–5,  13. … in the name of  our

Chapter 31

Of Synods and Councils

1.  For the better government, and further edification of  the church,
there ought to be such assemblies as are commonly called synods or
councils:a and it belongeth to the overseers and other rulers of  the
particular churches, by virtue of  their office, and the power which
Christ  hath  given  them  for  edification  and  not  for  destruction,  to
appoint such assemblies;b and to convene together in them, as often
as they shall judge it expedient for the good of  the church.c

2.  It belongeth to synods and councils, ministerially to determine

Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of  the flesh,
that the spirit may be saved in the day of  the Lord Jesus.… But them that are without
God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.  Matt.
18:17. And if  he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if  he neglect to
hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  Titus 3:10.
A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject.

a.  Acts 15:2,  4,  6. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension
and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other
of  them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.…
And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of  the church, and of  the
apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.… And
the apostles and elders came together for to consider of  this matter.

b.  Acts 15:1–35. And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the
brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of  Moses, ye cannot be
saved. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation
with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of  them, should
go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.… But there rose
up certain of  the sect of  the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to
circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of  Moses. And the apostles
and elders came together for to consider of  this matter.… Then pleased it the apostles
and  elders,  with  the  whole  church,  to  send  chosen  men  of   their  own  company  to
Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief
men among the brethren: and they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles
and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of  the Gentiles in
Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.… It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one
accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul.… For it
seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than
these necessary things.… So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and
when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: which when
they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.…

c.  Acts 15:1–35. See footnote b above.  Acts 20:17. And from Miletus he

sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of  the church.

controversies of  faith, and cases of  conscience; to set down rules and
directions for the better ordering of  the public worship of  God, and
government of  his church; to receive complaints in cases of  malad-
ministration, and authoritatively to determine the same: which de-
crees and determinations, if  consonant to the Word of  God, are to
be received with reverence and submission; not only for their agree-
ment with the Word, but also for the power whereby they are made,
as being an ordinance of  God appointed thereunto in his Word.d

3.  All synods or councils, since the apostles’ times, whether gen-
eral or particular, may err; and many have erred. Therefore they are
not to be made the rule of  faith, or practice; but to be used as a help
in both.e

4.  Synods and councils are to handle, or conclude nothing, but
that which is ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with civil af-
fairs which concern the commonwealth, unless by way of  humble

d.  Acts 15:15,  19,  24,  27–31. And to this agree the words of  the prophets; as it
is written … Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among
the Gentiles are turned to God.… Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which
went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must
be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment.… We
have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.
For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden
than  these  necessary  things;  that  ye  abstain  from  meats  offered  to  idols,  and  from
blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if  ye keep your-
selves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. So when they were dismissed, they came to Anti-
och: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:
which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.  Acts 16:4. And as they
went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were or-
dained of  the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.  Matt. 18:17–20. And if
he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if  he neglect to hear the
church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you,
Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto you, That if  two of  you shall
agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of
my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my
name, there am I in the midst of  them.

Jesus Christ himself  being the chief  corner stone.  Acts 17:11. These were more
noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of
mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.  1 Cor. 2:5.

Chapter 32

Of the State of Men after Death,

and of  the Resurrection of  the Dead

1.    The  bodies  of   men,  after  death,  return  to  dust,  and  see
corruption:a but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an
immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them:b
the souls of  the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are
received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of  God,
in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of  their bodies.c

f.  Luke 12:13–14. And one of  the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. And he said unto him, Man, who
made me a judge or a divider over you?  John 18:36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is
not of  this world: if  my kingdom were of  this world, then would my servants fight, that
I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.  Matt.
22:21. They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto
Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.

a.  Gen. 3:19. In the sweat of  thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
the ground; for out of  it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
return.  Acts 13:36. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption.

b.  Luke 23:43. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou
be with me in paradise.  Eccl. 12:7. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was:
and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

c.  Heb. 12:23. … to the general assembly and church of  the firstborn, which are
written in heaven, and to God the Judge of  all, and to the spirits of  just men made
perfect.  2 Cor. 5:1,  6,  8. For we know that if  our earthly house of  this tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building of  God, an house not made with hands, eternal in
the  heavens.… Therefore  we  are  always  confident,  knowing  that,  whilst  we  are  at
home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.… We are confident, I say, and willing
rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.  Phil. 1:23. For I
am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far
better.  Acts 3:21. … whom the heaven must receive until the times of  restitution of
all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of  all his holy prophets since the
world began.  Eph. 4:10. He that descended is the same also that ascended up far
above all heavens, that he might fill all things.  Rom. 8:23. And not only they, but
ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of  the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of  our body.

CHAPTER 32

And the souls of  the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in
torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of  the great
day.d Beside these two places, for souls separated from their bodies,
the Scripture acknowledgeth none.

2.  At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be
changed:e and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bod-
ies, and none other (although with different qualities), which shall be
united again to their souls forever.f

3.  The bodies of  the unjust shall, by the power of  Christ, be
raised to dishonor: the bodies of  the just, by his Spirit, unto honor;

d.  Luke 16:23–24. And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham,
have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of  his finger in water,
and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.  Acts 1:25. … that he may take
part of  this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he
might go to his own place.  Jude 6–7. And the angels which kept not their first estate,
but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of  the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities
about  them  in  like  manner,  giving  themselves  over  to  fornication,  and  going  after
strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of  eternal fire.
1 Pet. 3:19. … by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison.

e.  1 Thess. 4:17. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to-
gether with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be
with the Lord.  1 Cor. 15:51–52. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of  an eye, at the last trump:
for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
changed.

f.  John 5:25–29. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead shall hear the voice of  the Son of  God: and they that hear shall live. For
as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and
hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of  man.
Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall
hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection
of  life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of  damnation.  Acts 24:15.
And [I] have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a
resurrection of  the dead, both of  the just and unjust.  Job 19:26–27. And though
after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see
for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed
within me.  Dan. 12:2. And many of  them that sleep in the dust of  the earth shall
awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.  1 Cor.
15:42–44. So also is the resurrection of  the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised
in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is
raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural
body, and there is a spiritual body.

Chapter 33

Of  the Last Judgment

1.  God hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world, in
righteousness, by Jesus Christ,a to whom all power and judgment is
given of  the Father.b In which day, not only the apostate angels shall
be judged,c but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth shall
appear  before  the  tribunal  of   Christ,  to  give  an  account  of   their
thoughts, words, and deeds; and to receive according to what they
have done in the body, whether good or evil.d

g.  Acts 24:15. And [I] have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
that there shall be a resurrection of  the dead, both of  the just and unjust.  John 5:25–
29. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall
hear the voice of  the Son of  God: and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath
life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him
authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of  man. Marvel not at this:
for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and
shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of  life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of  damnation.  1  Cor.  15:43. It is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  Phil. 3:21.
… who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,
according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

a.  Acts 17:31. … because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the
world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof  he hath given
assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.

b.  John 5:22,  27. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judg-
ment unto the Son.… And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, be-
cause he is the Son of man.

c.  Jude 6. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment
of  the great day.  2 Pet. 2:4. For if  God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of  darkness, to be reserved unto
judgment …

d.  2 Cor. 5:10. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of  Christ; that
every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,
whether it be good or bad.  Eccl. 12:14. For God shall bring every work into judg-
ment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.  Rom. 2:16.
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of  men by Jesus Christ according to my
gospel.  Rom. 14:10,  12. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set
at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of  Christ.… So

2.  The end of  God’s appointing this day is for the manifestation
of  the glory of  his mercy, in the eternal salvation of  the elect; and of
his justice, in the damnation of  the reprobate, who are wicked and
disobedient. For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and
receive that fullness of  joy and refreshing, which shall come from the
presence of  the Lord: but the wicked, who know not God, and obey
not the gospel of  Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and
be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of  the
Lord, and from the glory of  his power.e

then every one of  us shall give account of  himself  to God.  Matt. 12:36–37. But I
say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
in the day of  judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
shalt be condemned.

e.  Matt. 25:31–46. When the Son of  man shall come in his glory, and all the
holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of  his glory: and before him
shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shep-
herd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but
the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
blessed of  my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of  the
world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink:
I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited
me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.… Then shall he say also unto them on the
left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and
his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me
no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick,
and in prison, and ye visited me not.… And these shall go away into everlasting pun-
ishment: but the righteous into life eternal.  Rom. 2:5–6. But after thy hardness and
impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself  wrath against the day of  wrath and revela-
tion of  the righteous judgment of  God; who will render to every man according to his
deeds.  Rom. 9:22–23. What if  God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his
power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of  wrath fitted to destruc-
tion: and that he might make known the riches of  his glory on the vessels of  mercy,
which he had afore prepared unto glory.  Matt. 25:21. His lord said unto him, Well
done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of  thy lord.  Acts 3:19.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the
times of  refreshing shall come from the presence of  the Lord.  2 Thess. 1:7–10.
… and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the gospel of  our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be
punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of  the Lord, and from the
glory of  his power; when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired
in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.

3.  As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there
shall be a day of  judgment, both to deter all men from sin; and for
the  greater  consolation  of   the  godly  in  their  adversity:f  so  will  he
have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off  all carnal
security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour
the Lord will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come Lord
Jesus, come quickly, Amen.g

f.   2  Pet.  3:11,   14. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what
manner of  persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness.… Where-
fore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of
him in peace, without spot, and blameless.  2 Cor. 5:10–11. For we must all appear
before the judgment seat of  Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his
body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore
the terror of  the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I
trust also are made manifest in your consciences.  2 Thess. 1:5–7. Which is a mani-
fest token of  the righteous judgment of  God, that ye may be counted worthy of  the
kingdom of  God, for which ye also suffer: seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled rest
with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels.
Luke 21:27–28. And then shall they see the Son of  man coming in a cloud with
power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.  Rom. 8:23–25. And not only
they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of  the Spirit, even we ourselves groan
within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of  our body. For we
are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he
yet hope for? But if  we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
g.  Matt. 24:36,  42–44. But of  that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the
angels of  heaven, but my Father only.… Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour
your Lord doth come. But know this, that if  the goodman of  the house had known in
what watch the thief  would come, he would have watched, and would not have suf-
fered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye
think not the Son of  man cometh.  Mark 13:35–37. Watch ye therefore: for ye know
not when the master of  the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing,
or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you
I say unto all, Watch.  Luke 12:35–36. Let your loins be girded about, and your
lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will
return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto
him immediately.  Rev. 22:20. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come
quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
